Lithuania has a national open data policy and has reached tangible results in amending legislation in this regard recently. 
Main legislation on open data policy:
1) The Law on the Right to Receive Information and Re-use of Data
https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.94745/asr 
Amendments to the Law on the Right to Receive Information and Re-use of Data entered into force in July 2021 transposing provisions of the Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information as well as establishing a Model for data opening which obliges institutions to inventory their data to know what data are owned by the state and open the data on user demand. The Law was revised on 01/01/2023.
https://eimin.lrv.lt/lt/naujienos/atveriami-dideles-vertes-duomenys-paskatins-nauju-produktu-kurima
2) Description of data opening procedure was approved by the Minister of Economy and Innovation on 01/04/2022
https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/327dd210495011ebb394e1efb98d3e67/asr

It ensures the overall data opening process of institutions, the quality of the open data, and favorable conditions for the reuse of data. It determines the data opening activities of institutions: appointment of persons responsible for organizing data opening, data inventory and creation of data sets to be opened, preparation of descriptions of data structure, usage of the State Data Management Information System for data anonymisation, data sets publication on the Lithuanian open data portal and ensuring feedback to open data users. 
3) Amendments to the Regulations of Lithuanian open data portal were made by Lithuanian Government on 25/03/2022

The essence of these changes is simpler and faster communication between data users (business) and data holders (public sector), as all communication takes place on the portal itself, without the need to write separate requests or inquiries. The business is able to request the missing data directly on the portal, if it cannot be found here. Thus, the data opening process becomes faster and of higher quality .";;;;30
2;yes;"Lithuanian open data ecosystem is based on 4 main elements: 1) strategic documents (STRATEGY), 2) legislation (POLICY), 3) competent bodies/instruments (BODIES), 4) financial measures/projects (PROJECTS).
STRATEGY:
Open data governance is one of main priorities of the Lithuanian Government. The Government pays particular attention to the implementation of good data governance and management best practices in the public sector and the widest possible opening and reuse of data, while encouraging the development of business products.  

 - Open data is on the top in the Lithuanian government’s four-year programme – according to the programme, data is the cornerstone behind the government’s decisions and communication. Please see 17-29 paragraphs of the Programme -  https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/973c87403bc311eb8c97e01ffe050e1c 

 - Lithuania’s strategy for open data is part of the plan for the implementation of the provisions of the program of the Eighteenth Government of the Republic of Lithuania. Open data is one of horizontal themes of actions, that are marked in the Plan with the letters AD (open data theme) - https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/d698ded086fe11eb9fecb5ecd3bd711c
Actions of the plan for the implementation of the provisions of the program of the Eighteenth Government of the Republic of Lithuania:
9.2.2. Develop and submit to the Government the concept of an open data and digital transformation competence center.
9.2.4. Update the creation, prioritization, monitoring, evaluation and management of open data sets
methodology - to create incentives and an obligation for authorities to open data.
9.2.5. Create a state data architecture (centralized descriptions of all data processed in the state), establish its governance model and ensure its implementation.
9.2.8. To create an ecosystem for assessing and promoting the quality of state information resources, open data and digital transformation.
9.2.11. Integrate the data of the state information systems and registers in the State Data Management Information System, implement their centralized opening and experimentation platforms (sandbox), ensure efficient exchange of data required for decision-making between institutions and create a mechanism for data anonymisation and aggregation. registers of statistical operators.

 - Data opening, as one of the strategic goals of the Lithuanian state, has also been put forward in the Lithuanian Digitization Development Programme for 2021–2030. The State Digitization Development Program is implemented through 4 measures of progress. One of the measures - Progress instrument no. 05-002-01-07-07 - Promote data availability and reuse, which includes activities financed by the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) plan.

According to Programme of the Eighteenth Government of the Republic of Lithuania: “Where possible, the Government will make and interpret decisions based on open data. We will ensure timely and orderly communication of open data to citizens and businesses. This would enable people, businesses and scientists to respond quickly and effectively to emerging challenges and to closely participate in decision-making”.
„RESPONSE TO REVIEWER“: Please see 19 Article at the Programme of the Eighteenth Government of the Republic of Lithuania (https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/973c87403bc311eb8c97e01ffe050e1c). One of Governement‘s targets is that open data would be published and available on real time.

POLICY:
The Law on the Right to Receive Information and Reuse of Data (https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/77d2b640dd6711eb866fe2e083228059?positionInSearchResults=0&searchModelUUID=cc1dc85c-32fd-4295-a64c-b3ba508bc7fe) transposes the provisions of Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information and includes concrete provisions on the dynamic and real-time data (please see Articles 3(10), 13(5)(6)(7)).
„RESPONSE TO REVIEWER“: The concept of dynamic and real-time data is defined in the law (Article 3(10)). The law also contains provisions on the provision of information and data: 
•	Access to variable data is provided through API that allows downloading this data in one go (Article 13(5))
•	The institution or state-run entity must ensure that the possibility to use dynamic data is provided as soon as it is collected or updated, with the exception of the exception established in paragraph 7 of this article (Article 13(6))
•	If an institution or a state-controlled entity ensures the possibility of using dynamic data immediately, as soon as it is collected or updated, the financial and technical burden would disproportionately increase, the possibility of re-using these variable data must be provided during such a period or by applying such technical restrictions that would not cause disruptions repeatedly use variable data (Article 13(7))";;"The information under the policy is relevant. Could you please elaborate on the "" concrete provisions on the dynamic and real-time data"" that are mentioned in the current answer?";;15

POLICY:
- According to Article 21 of the Law on Geodesy and Cartography of the Republic of Lithuania (https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/TAIS.143068/asr), the purpose of the Lithuanian Spatial Information Portal is to manage the metadata of spatial data sets and to provide spatial data sets and related services through one Internet portal (https://www.geoportal.lt/geoportal).  The procedure for managing the Lithuanian spatial information portal and providing spatial data sets to users is established in the Regulations of the Lithuanian Spatial Information Portal approved by the Minister of Agriculture. The Article 22 of the Law sets services provided by the Lithuanian Spatial Information Portal: 1 ) ""search service"" means a search for spatial data sets and services based on the content of certain metadata and the provision of the content of such metadata; 2 ) ""view service"" means to display, browse, zoom in, view a panoramic image or superimpose viewable spatial data sets, display them in a conventional manner and provide relevant metadata content; 3 ) ""download service"" means the downloading and direct access to copies of spatial data sets or parts thereof; 4 ) ""transformation service"" means the transformation of spatial data sets to achieve their interoperability; 5 ) spatial data activation service - to activate other spatial data or services according to one spatial data set or service.  In addition to the electronic services specified in Paragraph 1 of this Article, the Lithuanian Spatial Information Portal may also provide electronic services for the performance of functions related to spatial data sets, as well as for the performance of spatial data processing activities specified in the legal acts of state and municipal institutions.
In 2020, integrations between Lithuanian open data portal (data.gov.lt) and https://www.geoportal.lt/geoportal were implemented.

- General provisions on publication of high value data sets are set in the Article 16 of the Law on the Right to Receive Information and Reuse of Data ( https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/77d2b640dd6711eb866fe2e083228059?positionInSearchResults=0&searchModelUUID=cc1dc85c-32fd-4295-a64c-b3ba508bc7fe)";;;;15
6c;No;"It is possible for citizens to register and provide data same way as other government institutions do, but currently we don't have such cases. We avoid adding generated or derived data as separate datasets and instead, publish such dervied data, as data usecases [1], because we have quite strict quality requirements for datasets and usecases are much easier to publish. In future, we do have plans, to integerate with citizen-generated data such as data from OpenStreenMap project. The OpenStreetMap community is very active and has already done a lot of work [2].

- The Programme of the Government includes the chapter “Open Data” stating: „<...> 18. We undertake to make open data a key element in Government decision-making and communication. We will seek to make it serve as the basis in judging the necessity for decisions, in proposing decision mechanisms and in measuring outcomes. Where possible, the Government will make and interpret decisions based on open data <…>”.
- The Government Programme’s implementation plan provides the following action - To integrate data of the existing state information systems, realizing their opening and sandboxes, ensuring centralized data necessary for making decisions, efficient exchange between institutions, and creating a mechanism for anonymization and interconnection of data (deadline – 3rd Quarter 2024)
- Also, Open Government initiative contains measures that promote concepts for data-driven government, policy-making and decision-making

PROJECTS:
 - In order to speed up the process of data opening in state institutions, strengthen strategic management processes and data literacy, the Government Chancellery performes a project  financed with the funds of the European Union. Employees of the public sector participate in the dedicated trainings. During the implementation of the project, in April and May of 2022, a survey of employees of the ministries and the Government Chancellery was conducted. During it, it was requested to self-assess the knowledge and abilities of open data and its use. The results of the survey showed that a large part of the respondents are not yet sufficiently familiar with open data management, and rate their knowledge and abilities as average. For this purpose, the Government Chancellery acquired open data management practical skills training services. The training that took place in the fall 2022 provided practical skills in open data management. Around 75 employees of the Government Office and ministries participated in these trainings.

8;yes;"POLICY:
The Regulations of the Lithuanian open data portal sets conditions for opening data and managing requests on this portal. The Lithuanian open data portal https://data.gov.lt/ allows businesses and the public to conveniently receive and use data managed by public sector institutions on a one-stop basis. It is envisaged that data not published on this portal will be mandatory to open if such a request from data user is received and such data is not confidential. The responsible institution has to answer the requester within 5 working days from the date of submission of the request, what decision has been taken regarding the opening and submission of the requested data to the portal. The essence is simpler and faster communication between business and public sector data holders, as all communication takes place on the portal itself, without the need to write separate requests or inquiries. The business is able to request the missing data directly on the portal, if it cannot be found here. 

PRACTICE:
All data is provided in an easy to use and flexible API servcie [1], where all data are normalized, linked together and provided in various formats. Also we periodically do demos [2] with examples, how data can be used and interpreted. We do demos with experts of a field were data comes from.

PROJECTS:
Additional funding for empowering the use of open data is planned under EU Structural Funds investments for the period 2021-2027. The project aims to encourage the use of open data by businesses so that demand-driven data from public authorities are used to develop innovative solutions and digital services. Accordingly, the following activities are formulated in the project: 
•	Performance of joint public-private initiatives for the use of open data (show-case of use examples);
•	Business investments in the development of new innovative solutions using open data;
•	Business investments in the development of new digital services using open data;
The activities for the implementation of the measure are performed for the period 2021-2027. Funding is planned to be allocated through a call for proposals, with a joint call for proposals for all three of the above activities.

Generally, Lithuanian legislation does not oblige private businesses to open data, but also does not prohibit it. Business representatives can use all learning material and data opening tools, and some of them open data sets on their own initiative and publish them on the Lithuanian Open Data Portal - https://data.gov.lt/dataset/automatizuotu-buitiniu-vartotoju-valandiniai-duomenys-agreguoti-pagal-regiona.";;;;15

The aim of the reform is to ensure the availability of reliable public sector data, the possibility to share it, the possibilities for re-using the data and to create the preconditions for data-driven public policy as well as digital innovation in the private sector. 

Office of the Governance of the Republic of Lithuania strengthenes the (open) data analyst forces. There is established Analytics and Sustainable Governance Unit. (https://lrvk.lrv.lt/lt/struktura-ir-kontaktai/vyriausybes-kanceliarijos-kontaktai-1) Also, the Government is encouraging the establishment of data analyst units in ministries.

PROJECTS:
Over the period of 2023-2026, Lithuania will invest around 30M EUR to upgrade the data architecture and e-services of the governmental IT systems. The national data model will describe the data stored in every IT system. It will help raise the overall data maturity level and will be useful when constructing new IT solutions. New-generation digital service platform will enable construction of modern, user-friendly digital services that follow the once-only principle. It will also implement the European Union’s Single Digital Gateway concept, which allows EU citizens to access cross-border digital services through unified identification and data exchange services. After completing these projects, Lithuania will have a significantly improved infrastructure for building new-generation data-driven digital solutions.";;;;N/A
