3;yes;We are currently updating the OGD strategy 2019-2024 which will be followed by a master plan 2024-2027. Since we will have a legal framework (EMBAG) at the federal level from 2024 that includes an article on OGD (Art. 10), it is not necessary to implement a new strategy. But with the master plan we accompany the implementation of the legal framework and strengthen OGD in Switzerland. On the one hand, the OGD Master Plan 2024-2027 defines the implementation priorities to be pursued further, which originate from the last strategy period that is coming to an end, and on the other hand, it contains new measures beyond the year 2023. The Master Plan will be based on five focus areas (S): (S01) more Open Data, (S02) better quality of (meta-)data, (S03) better accessibility of OGD, (S04) more synergies, and (S05) more exchange.;;;;10

39a;yes;"Response to reviewers: Since automn 2022, the portal opendata.swiss has a showcase form for data users to easily submit their showcases, see button ""Submit showcase"" on the showcases page: https://opendata.swiss/en/showcase. The process of collecting and reviewing showcases is now much easier. The OGD Office encourages at every opportunity (e.g. events, Twitter, LinkedIn) to upload showcases. Another way to collect reuse cases is the example of the open data portal of the city of Bern: they have formulated potential ideas and questions for the reuse of their open data and added links to corresponding datasets, see: https://www.bern.ch/open-government-data-ogd/ideen-fuer-dienstleistungen.
Another way is to bring together students and data publishers. An example is that of the Bern University of
of Applied Sciences: https://www.digitale-nachhaltigkeit.unibe.ch/studium/open_data_veranstaltung/fruehjahrssemester_2023/index_ger.html. It encourages the collaboration between public bodies and students. They are looking for data coaches every year. The students reuse open data from different public bodies, one example is from the canton of Thurgau: https://ogd.tg.ch/anwendungen/open-data-vorlesung-2022.html/14316.

40;I don't know;"There is a study from 2019 about how the concept ""open data"" and ""transparency"" are related and perceived in public administration in Switzerland: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15309576.2019.1657914 
""The impact of open data on the perception of transparency does not seem to be significant. Our findings show that open data does not increase the transparency of public administrations, which is understood as a continuous process that goes beyond simple data provision. This perception is certainly motivated by the fact that the random release of datasets does not always make them useful or valuable for users (Susha et al., Citation2015). In this sense, it appears crucial to note that open data, if it is to serve the purpose of greater administrative transparency, should be developed in a way that guarantees possible reuse by and empowerment of citizens.""";;;;0
41;yes;"""- Digital Twin City of Zurich - Previously, architects had to order the 3D data relevant to their construction projects by phone or mail. Clerks then created the desired data manually, made it available to the architects via FTP and then triggered an invoice. This involved all accounting processes. OGD eliminated all administrative processes and customers had their data available immediately and at any time. And another example: Data on Road noise emissions for construction clients. Since the beginning of 2023 a new emission calculation model ""sonROAD18"" became state of the art in Zurich. As of this date, road noise calculations may only be performed using the new model. Since July 2022, the Noise Abatement Department has made the relevant data about emissions of the road noise pollution register according to sonROAD18 freely available to the acoustics offices and other interested parties in a specially prepared form and together with other basic data for noise calculations. Also here, the relevant Open Data was included in the relevant process from the beginning, leading to very efficient and effective processes.
- Government organizations are motivated to publish data on the data portal because they can use the tool that the OGD Portal from Basel-City uses to create simple dashboards and analytics. Here is an example of the Covid dashboard and the traffic accident dashboard. https://data.bs.ch/pages/verkehrsunfall_dashboard_basel/ 
https://data.bs.ch/pages/covid-19-dashboard/ They have received feedback that this saves them a lot of time and effort. 
- Regional OGD portals support their offices in transforming the structured information into machine-readable datasets, describing them with metadata and using them to produce information for the general public. Building your application directly on open data is more efficient. For example as visualization: https://www.zh.ch/de/sicherheit-justiz/sicher-unterwegs/verkehrsunfallstatistiken.html 
- For example drinking water quality canton zurich - Here, the cantonal laboratory and the municipalities themselves measure. Both now flow into two OGD datasets (one classic from the laboratory, one that is continuously filled in collaboratively by the municipalities) and these two datasets flow into an overview of drinking water quality. This massively improves administrative processes. https://www.zh.ch/de/gesundheit/lebensmittel/trinkwasser.html#160754451 // Data for an efficient mobility system: https://www.bav.admin.ch/bav/en/home/general-topics/mmm.html""";;;;15
42;yes;"""- The general rule is that if you publish data, then you are part of the process of being more transparent as a government. For example the Energy Dashboard of the Swiss Federal Office of Energy provides an up-to-date overview of the state of energy supply in Switzerland: https://www.energiedashboard.admin.ch/dashboard. response to the reviewers: For example the data from this dashboard was used and journalistically prepared by SRF (Swiss radio and television) in this article. https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/moegliche-energiekrise-so-viel-strom-verbraucht-die-schweiz-und-weitere-grafiken 
- Because the role of data is becoming increasingly important for the city, open and transparent communication about the collection and use of this data is significant: The city of Zurich for example is testing in a pilot trial how it can make the collection of data in public spaces more visible. In concrete terms, this is being done by clearly labelling sensors with pictograms. In addition, the latest available data of the respective sensors will be prepared on the website of the city of Zurich and made accessible on site via QR code. For this purpose, only data from already existing sensors is used, which is open and freely accessible as ""open data"": https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/prd/de/index/stadtentwicklung/smart-city/transparenz.html - part of this sensor data is offered as visualisation, for example: https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/prd/de/index/stadtentwicklung/smart-city/transparenz/luft/stampfenbachstrasse.html   
- Climate and energy-relevant information for all Swiss residential buildings can now be seen on the federal government's geoportal. It is possible to estimate for all buildings how much CO2 is emitted under standard conditions. This creates transparency around climate and energy policy in the buildings sector and contributes to achieving Swiss climate targets: https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/climate/info-specialists/reduction-measures/buildings/calculator-co2-buildings.html - the CO2 calculator is also mentioned on various webpages, for example: https://www.lignum.ch/auf_einen_klick/news/lignum_journal_holz_news_schweiz/news_detail/interaktiver-co2-rechner-auf-dem-geoportal-des-bundes/, https://www.energieplan-wallis.ch/aktuelles/interaktiver-co2-rechner-auf-dem-geoportal-des-bundes-56, https://www.fachbau.ch/de/die-baustellen/2023-04-21/interaktiver-co2-rechner-auf-dem-geoportal-des-bundes/, https://www.murgenthal.ch/public/upload/assets/2385/Murgenthaler%20Gemeinde-Nachrichten%20Mai%202023.pdf?fp=2";;"Please describe the impact of these examples.

The most popular freely accessible geodata set of the city of Zurich has been downloaded from the geoportal over 4500 times since the end of 2018. Now this data can be easily displayed in a playful way. Users can, for example, measure the height of the buildings shown or call up further information on them at the click of a mouse. Furthermore, they can display the shadows cast on any day and at any time of day, and with the simple address search they can find any building in the entire city. Both applications are primarily aimed at all players in the building industry, namely planners, architects and engineers. The numerous visualisation and analysis options allow work at different scales - from the overall city view to the detailed building model. The underlying technology is already being used within the administration for the visualisation of noise simulations, in the context of architectural competitions or for the integral representation of civil engineering and building construction projects, see: https://innovators-guide.ch/2022/02/digital-die-stadt-zuerich-erkunden-in-bis-zu-vier-dimensionen/, article about the potential of the digital twin for Urban Planning: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41064-020-00092-2, from smart city to responsive city the use of 3D-Open Geodata: https://wherenext.esri.de/responsive-city-stadt-zurich/  // visualisation in the media: Based on the latest data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, they compared the nine largest Swiss cities according to income, housing theft, street noise, green spaces, etc.: https://www.srf.ch/news/gesellschaft/lebensqualitaet-ranking-2023-11-ranglisten-zur-lebensqualitaet-in-schweizer-staedten;;Please also describe the impact of these examples of open data being put to use;;15

123;yes;We have DCAT-AP CH in version 1, which was created in 2018 and builds on DCAT-AP version 1. Version 2.0.0 has recently been approved by eCH. The definition area is https://dcat-ap.ch/. There you will find both versions of the DCAT-AP CH. The portal is mainly based on the DCAT-AP conformance, but also on the version 1 of the DCAT-AP CH, as it contains some Swiss fields used by the community. The decision to create a version 2 of DCAT-AP CH and to keep a national application profile was a difficult one. We decided to keep it because there are particularities in the use of the standard, there are properties such as distribution coverage that the Swiss community relies on and that can't be found in DCAT-AP. The vocabulary also needs Swiss adaptations. Licences are used in a different way than in DCAT-AP. We felt that it would better support the Swiss community if Switzerland maintained its own profile and explained how classes and properties are adapted to the Swiss context. While version 1 of DCAT-AP CH was not DCAT-AP compatible with version 2.0.1 of DCAT-AP. DCAT-AP CH V2 is now compatible with DCAT-AP.;;;;5
124a;yes;N/A;;;;25
124b;see answer box;As we are a CKAN portal, the main reason for the lack of DCAT-AP compliance is that as a portal we can't pass through complex data catalogue structures coming from data publishers, even if they are DCAT-AP compliant. We map RDF to postgres on import and postgres to RDF on export. In the process, we lose classes and properties that we don't use on opendata.swiss. What we are trying to do in terms of DCAT-AP compliance is to make our export DCAT-AP compliant as well as making sure that our import is DCAT-AP compliant. But there is still something that gets lost in this internal mapping. A recent example that illustrates this is the categories. We map EU categories, but the portal has Swiss categories implemented. So we might get EU categories from a datapublisher, but because of the mapping to postgres, we would map those categories to Swiss categories and on export to EU categories. His original EU categories will be lost.;;;;15
