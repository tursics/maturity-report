1;other;"Entry into force of the EEA Joint Committee Decision is pending incorporating the Open Data Directive into the EEA agreement. Work has begun in the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation on a draft legislation to be introduced to parliament in the autumn. Iceland previously implemented the PSI, see https://www.althingi.is/lagas/153b/2018045.html.
There is not a specific national open data policy but it it is addressed in the following policies: 
-The policy regarding digital public services (digital policy) where open data maturity is a metric, see https://island.is/en/o/digital-iceland/digital-strategy
-The information policy of the government, which states that information and data sets should be digitally available for use and processing, see https://www.stjornarradid.is/verkefni/log-og-rettur/upplysingalog/upplysingastefna-stjornvalda/ 
-The regulation on the publication of information at the initiative of the government, no 464/2018, see https://island.is/reglugerdir/nr/0464-2018
-The Agreement on the Platform for the Coalition Government that work will continue on co-ordinating the processing, storage and presentation of public data, and on facilitating public access to data, see https://www.stjornarradid.is/rikisstjorn/stjornarsattmali/.";;;;30

This included a more detailed definition on what data is open data. The primary emphasis of the policy was that data should be open unless there are specific reasons for it not to be. The data security classification serves as a basis for further work on open data strategy. Version 1.2 was published in May 2023.
The information policy was published in December 2022, see https://www.stjornarradid.is/verkefni/log-og-rettur/upplysingalog/upplysingastefna-stjornvalda/
