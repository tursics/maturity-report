106;yes;We have a clearly defined metadata approach conform DCAT. So the government organisations can check if the metadata is up to date conform the standard. The datamanagement team of the portal every day checks if the (meta)data is right and if we miss datasets we contact the data owners. Documentation is published for anyone to check how to validate against the Dutch DCAT application profile of DCAT. Currently the DCAT-AP 2 DONL is being created which will implement DCAT AP 2;;;;20

Either based on their own investigations, feedback from users or data requests from users, we can ask and assist data providers to publish their data in machine-readable formats.
