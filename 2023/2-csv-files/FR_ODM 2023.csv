;"Please note that this section differentiates between open data policy and open data strategy. Policy here refers to all principles/initiatives set out to achieve the goals established by the Open Data Directive, including specific national legislation put in place to transpose the EU law. With strategy, on the other hand, we define a document outlining the concrete vision, mission, objectives, measures to be implemented, timeline and responsible. An open data strategy would ideally include information on the open data governance structure and operating model.

* If yes, please provide (1) the URL and (2) title of the policy document and briefly describe.
* If ‘other’, please provide (1) a brief explanation to support your answer choice and (2) provide the URL and indicate the policy section which explicitly references open data.";yes;"The open data policy in France is called “Politique d’ouverture et de partage des données publiques”. The French government and the local authorities are strongly committed to opening government data and never ceases to reaffirm their desire to work toward.

Article 15 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of 1789, which is part of the French constitution, states that Society has the right to hold any Public Official accountable for its administration. **This principle created very early a right to access the data and never stoped guided all the evolution in open data policy in France.**

The law of 17 July 1978 on freedom of access to administrative documents (”loi CADA”) establishes a framework on access to information, codified in the Code of relations between the public and the administration (Code des relations entre le public et l’administration).

The cornerstone of the French open data policy is the 2016’s Digital Republic Law [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000033202746](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000033202746), also transposed in the Code of relations between the public and the administration. **The Digital Republic Law** led to significant progress in terms of open data and national data policy including the “**Open Data by default**” principle and the Public Service Data.

**According to the french decree of october 25 2019, the Interministerial Digital directorate is in charge of the coordination and the promotion of the inventory, governance, production, circulation, use and opening of data. [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000039281619](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000039281619)**

**Recently edited by a modificative decree of April 22 2023, the french government confirmed the importance allocated to the open data policy in it’s governmental roadmap.**

[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000047478124](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000047478124?init=true&page=1&query=%222022%2F868%22&searchField=ALL&tab_selection=all)

In April 2021, Prime Minister Jean Castex, through a circular on the national data, algorithms and source code policy, reiterated the need for an ambitious open data policy, and called on the Government to make data a strategic priority: ""I would like the Government to have a renewed ambition in terms of the use, openness and circulation of public data, algorithms and source codes for the benefit of users, researchers, innovators and all our fellow citizens."" [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/circulaire/id/45162](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/circulaire/id/45162).

On top of the general framework, open data policy is also characterised by specific sectoral legislation. Here are few recent examples.

- The law on the orientation of mobility [https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/loi-dorientation-des-mobilites](https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/loi-dorientation-des-mobilites) with specific disposition on transport data including real-time data.
- The changes to the Research code [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/texte_lc/LEGITEXT000006071190/](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/texte_lc/LEGITEXT000006071190/) implemented by the Digital Republic Law regarding open research data

The Open Data Directive has already been transposed [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/NIM/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.172.01.0056.01.ENG](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/NIM/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2019.172.01.0056.01.ENG) and most provisions were already part of the French legal framework.

**In 2022, the french lawmaker once again get into high gear with the adoption of the “3DS” law (differentiation, decentralization, deconcentration and simplification) which stated for the acceleration of the sharing data processes between administrations, and especially between central administrations and local administrations.** [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFSCTA000045197502](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFSCTA000045197502)

**During the last Inter-ministerial Committee for Public Transformation (CITP), the Prime Minister announced that each ministry will adopt new ministerial roadmaps on data, algorithms and source code policy by the end of 2023. These new roadmaps, symbol of an invariably renewed ambition, present the ambitions and challenges of public policies related to data, algorithms and public source codes, the concrete priority actions to be launched and the governance set up to ensure their implementation.**

The Government made a commitment to open more high-impact key datasets, APIs and source codes in the near future. The list of such datasets and their publication schedule is available here [https://ouverture.data.gouv.fr/](https://ouverture.data.gouv.fr/)

Each ministry has defined its strategy in the field of data, algorithms and source codes, and has broken it down into a plan of action over a 2 to 3 year period. The Minister for Public Transformation and Civil Service unveiled these 15 roadmaps on Monday 27 September 2021. These roadmaps include actions for all central government organisations and agencies. **Most of these roadmaps are foreseeing actions until 2024.**

3;"Has this national strategy/policy been updated in the past 24 months?

For Justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the main changes. ";yes;"In march 2023, the Interministerial Digital directorate adopted a brand new roadmap defining some news goals in order to support and ensure the success of the State's digital projects. This new multi-year plan is focused around the improvement of public action’s efficiency, and especially on the government’s priority policies. Based on the observation that open data practices have made their way into central and local administrations, the Interministerial Digital Directorate has decided to strengthen the exploitation of the potential of open data. In this wake, the new roadmap draws a clear direction : taking advantage of an effective use of data for a more efficient and simpler State for citizens, companies and public agents. This shift, made possible by a long-standing acculturation, constitutes a direct extension of the mission that drives the French government since 2011, determined to use its open data policy as a powerful lever for efficiency.

(https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/feuille-de-route-dinum/)

As previously mentioned, During the last Inter-ministerial Committee for Public Transformation (CITP), the Prime Minister announced that each ministry will adopt new ministerial roadmaps on data, algorithms and source code policy by the end of 2023.

These new roadmaps will be a continuation of the previous roadmaps and will address the new challenges of public policy on data for the French central administration and will define new concrete priority actions.

4;"Is there any further open data policy/strategy at regional or local level?

For Justification:
* If yes, please (1) provide the URL and (2) title of the document(s) and (3) briefly describe.";yes;"Subnational governments (regions for NUTS 1, departments for NUTS 3, and communes as local administrative units) remain independent in their own strategy and are not obliged to publish their data on the national portal data.gouv.fr. Nonetheless, the principle of open data by default enshrined in the law (Code des relations entre le public et l'administration) applies to all subnational governments with at least 3500 inhabitants.

Every year, more and more local actors are adopting strategies within this framework. According to the last local open data observatory provided by the french national association “Open Data France”, the number of local authorities involved in an open data strategy increased by 18% compared to 2021. Today, there are approximately 250 local open data portals in France.

(https://www.observatoire-opendata.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Copie-de-Observatoire_Open_Data_Territoires_Edition2022.pptx-1.pdf)

For example : 

- Lyon : https://data.grandlyon.com/demarche)
- Lille : https://opendata.lillemetropole.fr/page/demarche/
- Nantes’ metropolitan data charter https://metropole.nantes.fr/charte-donnee
- DataSud : https://www.datasud.fr/presentation-du-projet-datasud/

On top of that, the data, algorithms and source codes roadmap of the Ministry of Territorial Cohesion points out the strategy of the State on how to improve data sharing between national and local actors. 

(https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/uploads/feuillederoute_mctrct.pdf)

In a different way, the french government also allocated a “Digital transformation of local authorities (ITN7)"" fund, part of the France Relance plan, in order to grant various projects to help local authorities to adopt open data practices and draw their own strategies in this area. This fund contributed to the implementation of “Collec-Data”, a praised project on the occasion of “Digital and Territories day”, that has helped Breton local authorities to scale up their use of open data. The Collec-data platform now allows more than 1600 local authorities to automatically publish their data and will soon allows them to massify the publication of data and systematize the valorization.

(https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/actualites/retour-sur-la-journee-numerique-et-territoires/)

This movement is also promised to a strong acceleration thanks to the adoption of the 3DS law, previously mentioned, which is going to facilitate the coordination of data exchanges between the national and local levels. In addition, and to support this movement, the french minister of transformation and public service charged three politicians to identify the opportunities for the enhancement of data exploitation by local authorities with a strong impact-driving focus. This analysis should help local authorities in the construction of their own data policies and strategies at their own level and incentivise their initiatives in the open data field.

(https://www.transformation.gouv.fr/files/presse/cp_utilisation_donnee_collectivites_territoriales_mission.pdf)

Moreover, the national association Open Data France is also currently conducting a study on the whole french territory to identify all the local open data use cases, in close connection with many different public bodies such as the national portal data.gouv.fr.

5;"Does the national strategy/policy include an action plan with measures to be implemented in the open data field?

For justification:
If yes, please briefly describe the main measures described by the action plan.";yes;"In April 2021, the Prime Minister, in a circular, underlined that the national data policy must be a strategic priority for the State and its relations with local authorities and private actors. The circular mandates that:

- All ministries, as well as all regional State authorities (préfets) have to nominate a CDO in order to ensure a data opening governance at the highest hierarchical level;
- The Interministerial Director for Digital Affairs, acting as General Data Administrator, will coordinate the network of CDOs
- An ""ombudsman for general interest data"" will be nominated to negotiate with private actors that have data that is deemed to be of general interest;
- The Ministry of Research will set up a charter to speed up the processing of requests from researchers wishing to access data;
- Each Ministry will need to animate the ecosystems of data and source code reusers, in order to identify high value-added datasets, define possible standards and encourage sharing, with a focus on the Open Government Partnership forum as an arena for such exchanges;
- Each ministry will have to set up a roadmap for data, algorithms and source code strategy, with actions and deadlines. The roadmap will also list the skills in those fields within the personnel of the ministries.
- Open data will be referenced in the national portal data.gouv.fr

Moreover, the Government made a commitment to open more high-impact key datasets, APIs and source codes in the near future. Some of those engagements are marking out their action until 2025.** The list of such datasets and their publication schedule is available here (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/tableau-de-suivi-des-ouvertures-de-donnees-codes-sources-et-api-publics-avril-2021/)";;;;;25
6a;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to real-time or dynamic data?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"The 2015 law on growth, activity and equal economic opportunities (Loi Macron) had set obligations to publish data on real time transport schedules [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000030978561/](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000030978561/). The 2019 law on the orientation of mobilities [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000039666574/](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000039666574/) made a step further by not only transposing into national law the European Delegated Regulation 2017/1926 of 31 May 2017 [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R1926](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32017R1926), but also by including dynamic data. According to this law, static and dynamic travel and traffic data, as well as historical traffic data, shall be made accessible and reusable.

The Open Data parliamentary mission led by MP Éric Bothorel also points out the key role of real-time data, especially within the transport domain.

The transport.data.gouv.fr task force deploys special efforts to promote real-time data. This includes [documentation](https://doc.transport.data.gouv.fr/producteurs/operateurs-de-transport-regulier-de-personnes/temps-reel-des-transports-en-commun) on standardisation, an [inventory of real time](https://transport.data.gouv.fr/real_time) data yet to be standardised, and [discussion with stakeholders](https://doc.transport.data.gouv.fr/documentation/liste-des-rencontres-publiques/20-09-2018-transport-regulier-temps-reel).

The data, algorithms and source codes roadmap of the Ministry of Ecological Transition clearly underlines the need for systematic access to real-time data, especially related to environmental phenomena, to improve the impact of environmental policies. [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/25f0f375-df81-4cc5-8eae-c277a729923f](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/25f0f375-df81-4cc5-8eae-c277a729923f)";Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time). ;;;;15
6b;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to geo-spatial data (e.g. in relation to high-value datasets as specified in the implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138)?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"The geo-spatial data ecosystem has drastically changed in the latest year with a renewed ambition around digital commons. The National Institute for Geographic and Forestry Information (Institut national de l’information géographique et forestière, IGN) opened all its datasets in January 2021 (https://www.ign.fr/sites/default/files/2020-12/cp_gratuite_donnees_2020.pdf) and published an ambitious strategy : https://www.ign.fr/publications-de-l-ign/institut/kiosque/publications/cadrage_strategique.pdf. 

This goes along with other strategies on geo-spatial data : 

- The data roadmap of the Ministry of Ecological transition  : https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/uploads/feuillederoute_mte_mer.pdf
- The data roadmap of the Ministry of territorial cohesion : https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/uploads/feuillederoute_mctrct.pdf

The government has also intensified the support it provides to the IGN to make possible the transformation of IGN’s economic model. This new model should allow an universal and free distribution of thematic data, especially in relation to high-value datasets, as well as the core data produced by the Institute.

(https://www.ign.fr/publications-de-l-ign/institut/kiosque/publications/plan_activites_ign_2023.pdf)

In the wake of this broad movement, it should also be noted that France has already opened a large majority of datasets belonging to the “geospatial” and “earth observation and environment” category as defined by the implementing regulation on HVD. Most of these data are provided by institutions that are constantly encouraged to work towards the opening of their data, such as IGN, Insee or CSTB. Right after the adoption of the implementing regulation on High-Value datasets, the National Council of Geolocalised Information, which coordinates the evolution of geolocalised information in France, integrated the High-Value datasets in its data categorization page.

(http://cnig.gouv.fr/categorisations-a15646.html)

At the same time, the government progressively started to require the implementation of high-value datasets obligations from some public bodies. For instance, in the last proposition of Budget Settlement and State Accounts Approval Bill for 2022, the Minister of the Economy clearly defined the obligation to disclose the data targeted by this new regulation within 16 months as a key element of the state-subventions allocated to National Institute of Geographic and Forestry Information.
(https://www.budget.gouv.fr/documentation/file-download/20427)";"Geo-spatial data is data that contains information on properties that are linked to a position on earth.

The portal allows everyone to publish data, with a badge to identify data from official sources (i.e. public sector organisations). But the guides, the publication process, and the tools are the same, whether the data provider is a ministry or a journalist, an activist, a student.

For example, the tools that help improve the quality of data, [schema.data.gouv.fr](http://schema.data.gouv.fr) and publier.etalab.studio, are both free and open to use.";Citizen-generated data is the data that people or their organisations produce to directly monitor, demand or drive change on issues that affect them.;;;;15
6d;"Does the national strategy/policy foster the discoverability of the aforementioned types of data from your country on data.europa.eu?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe how.";yes;"The French open data policy makes it mandatory for central government and national public sector organisations to publish data on [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr) (the obligation is stated both in the 2019 decree creating the DINUM [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000039281619/](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000039281619/) and in the 2021 Prime ministerial circular on data policy [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/circulaire/id/45162](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/circulaire/id/45162)). This centralisation is also done in order to foster the discoverability on data.europa.eu, as the data.gouv.fr catalogue is harvested by the European portal. To keep the discoverability standards at the highest level through the time, the data.gouv team has strategically chosen to frequently integrates the feedback of the plateform’s users. Thanks to this strategy, in 2022 the national portal benefited of several modifications enhancing the discoverability of all the data uploaded and harvested such as :

- A complete overhaul of the search engine and research experience to improve its efficiency;
- An overhaul of the previsualization system and the implementation of a data explorer tool.
- An overhaul and an update of the thematic inventory to spotlight some symbolic data.

In the roadmap of the Ministry of Civil Service and Public Transformation (Ministère de la transformation et de la fonction publiques), action A24 focuses on improving data quality and the creation of a data quality label on data.gouv.fr. This label will incentivise data producers to fill in all metadata, and as a consequence will improve discoverability both on data.gouv.fr and data.europa.eu.";;;;;10
7;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to support the reuse of open data by the public sector?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"**Plan de relance**

As previously mentioned, within the framework of the Next Generation EU recovery plan (France Relance), the Government set up [a grant for public administrations that want to develop the use of data in public decision-making and performance](https://france-relance.transformation.gouv.fr/96c0-developper-lutilisation-de-la-donnee-dans-vot). Such grants will fund projects focused on data-driven government (data visualisation and decision-making support tools), opening and circulation of data, improving data quality. Project leaders are encouraged to support the opening of data and the reuse of open data within the project.

**Prime Ministerial circular on data policy**

In his april 2021 circular (https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/circulaire/id/45162), Prime Minister Jean Castex reiterated the need for public administrations to strive for open data circulation and re-use. One of the roles of the ministerial CDOs is to animate the ecosystem of re-users of their ministries’ data.

**Ministerial data roadmaps**

The aforementioned ministerial roadmaps on data, algorithms, and source codes (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/feuilles-de-route-ministerielles-sur-la-politique-de-la-donnee-des-algorithmes-et-des-codes-sources/) focus also on how to incentivise and support (open) data re-use within the respective ministries and agencies. For example, in the roadmap of the Ministry of Ecological Transition, a full section is dedicated on how to improve data quality to encourage reuse, and on how to use data for policy-making. The roadmap of the Ministry of Culture includes training measures for senior decision-makers on data-driven management.

**Raising awareness among public officials on the issue of data exploitation**

Chiefs Data Officers and Open Data Officers have been appointed in different ministries and operators. For these two categories of public servants, workshops are organised regularly (once or twice a quarter) to raise their awareness and train them on the question of data reuse (case studies, presentations of tools etc.). For example, a ""data driven policy"" workshop was organised during a seminar organised for the chief data officers. The objective of this workshop was to think collaboratively on how the chief data officer of each ministry could influence the development and implementation of public policies by reusing data. Examples are also given in the chief data officer report.

**At the local level**

The central government has also been fully committed to promote greater re-use of open government data by the public sector at the local level, through a partnership with [OpenDataFrance] (https://www.opendatafrance.net/), an association whose mission is to support local authorities on opening their data. OpenDataFrance has developed a service offer adapted to each territory (awareness, training, etc.) and provides resources to help local communities implement an open data strategy. The State subsidises OpenDataFrance’s actions and Etalab closely works with the association, namely on the promotion of open data re-use at a local level. Thus, their action encourages greater re-use of open government data by the local public sector.

**Etalab Inventory**
In the fall of 2021, the Etalab team inventoried projects based on the reuse of Public Data Service (PDS) reference data. This inventory highlights the large amount of open data reuse by public persons and encourages them to continue developing more projects based on open data reuse.
The dataset categorizes usage examples by issue, sector topic, type of impact, and type of public reuser.

**The creation of Datalab**

Thanks to the solid foundation of public data in France, the Interministerial Digital Directorate has recently been provided with new resources to support the ambition of fostering the reuse of data in the public sector and encouraging the emergence of impactful projects. Within this directorate, the ""datalab"", an incubator for data-related projects within the DINUM, has been specially created to accelerate public sector projects based in part on the reuse of open data.

(https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/espace-presse/stanislas-guerini-guichet-10-millions-deuros-projets-exploiter-donnees-publiques/)

**The implementation of a data-dedicated funding window**

In the same way, the Interministerial Digital Directorate officially launched in January 2023 a data-dedicated funding window, amounting to 10 million of euros, to co-finance projects around data in the ministries in order to fully exploite public datas as a simplification lever.

8;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to support the reuse of open data by the private sector?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"France follows a “Government as a platform” approach in order to develop its digital services for both public and private actors. The overall (open) data policy and the subsequent strategy documents have been written by taking into account the needs of both the public and the private sector. This is why the law allows for commercial reuse of open data, and the Open Licence 2.0 adopted by the government reiterates this principle.

The ministerial roadmaps also look at how to promote data re-use by the private sector.

For example, the roadmap of the Ministry of Ecological Transition includes a section on “Sharing data through public-private cooperation”. Quoting the roadmap, “The use of data by the private sector is a vector of value for citizens or the community as a whole and improves the effectiveness of public action”. Five actions are put forward to support re-use by private actors.

The importance of open data re-use by private actors is underlined also in the final report of the Open Data Mission led by MP Éric Bothorel, with a specific focus on the national company registry (base SIRENE) and land value data (demandes de valeurs foncières, DVF).";These measures could promote concepts such as smart cities and/or regions, but also new business development (in particular Small - and Medium-sized Enterprises), entrepreneurship etc.;;;;15
9a;"Does the national strategy/policy mandate carrying out and maintaining a data inventory by public bodies, whether at national or local level?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly specify.";yes;"**Legal framework**

According to the code on relations between the public and the administration (Article L312-1-1) (https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000033205512/), public actors (and private actors who carry out a public service mission) have to publish in open data the inventory of administrative documents that they produce as part of their public service missions. For example, the Ministry of the Economy has the ""Répertoire des Informations Publiques des Ministères Economiques et Financiers"", which consists of the official publications produced by the departments of the economic and financial ministries, including date that must be opened and data that must not. (https://www.economie.gouv.fr/cedef/repertoire-des-informations-publiques).

**Prime Ministerial circular on data policy**

In his april 2021 circular (https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/circulaire/id/45162), Prime Minister Jean Castex ordered to each Ministry to develop a data strategy roadmap. Such roadmaps will list the objectives related to steering, opening, circulation, and sharing of data. The Prime Minister also asked ministries to reference open data on the national portal data.gouv.fr. Within this framework, Ministries are drafting data inventories in order to comply with the Government objectives.

**Tech.gouv strategy on inventories :**

[Tech.gouv](https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/tech-gouv-strategie-et-feuille-de-route-2019-2021/), the interministerial programme for digital transformation, has created a new mission called “Data”. One of the objectives of this mission is to create a platform for data exchange between administrations. The first step of this project is to mandate ministries to conduct an inventory of the data produced. Data circulation cannot take place without a clear knowledge of the available datasets. An interdepartmental inventory is being developed to give administrations greater visibility on the data produced at a national level. This work is carried out in collaboration with the relevant contacts of each administration.

**Etalab’s work on inventories :**

- **Producers assistance:**

Etalab collaborates with chief data officers and open data officers of each ministry to help them carry out the inventory of the data within their scope. Workshops are organized to identify the key variables of the different inventories. Several ministries, such as the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of the Army, are starting to work on their respective data inventories. Ministerial staff from the Ministry of Ecological Transition and the Ministry of the Sea directly asked Etalab to assist them with the collaboration of other stakeholders in the technical development of the inventory.

- **Inventory pages**

For some subjects we gather all relevant datasets on a single page on the national portal : an example on elections data is available here (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/donnees-des-elections/). We found that it fosters data discoverability and reuse since it is possible to give more context on the datasets and link between them.

- **The data.gouv.fr catalog**

**In April 2023, nearly 45 000 datasets are referenced on data.gouv.fr**. This figure may seem dizzying for re-users who wish to discover the public data offer of data.gouv.fr. In order to provide better visibility of the published data sets, the team has provided the [data catalog of data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/catalogue-des-donnees-de-data-gouv-fr/) in open data since June 2019. This dataset provides information on the list of datasets, resources, reuse, organizations, tags, harvesters, and discussions published on data.gouv.fr.

- **Specific inventories**

In order to focus our efforts to make more data available in an open format, Etalab has realised some inventories for specific themes: health, labour, housing, key geo-spatial reference data, COVID-19, etc. (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/thematiques-a-la-une/). These inventories, which are available in open data, list all open and closed data sources for the specific themes, for all actors involved in the field. The aim is to help us prioritise which data should be available as open data. **These specific inventories can also be used to highlight the importance of certain data according to current events. For example, in the face of a European and global energy crisis, the national portal (http://data.gouv.fr/) has undertaken to reference the main datasets related to the ""energy"" theme available.**

(https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/donnees-energie/)

- **Interministerial catalogation tool**

In order to help ministries and public sector organisation realise a data inventory, Etalab is currently developing a tool that will allow organisations to create an inventory, manage it, publish it in open data. (https://catalogue.data.gouv.fr/)
The source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/etalab/catalogage-donnees).";A data inventory is a comprehensive catalogue of datasets held by an organisation.;;;;15
9b;"If yes [in Q9a], do these data inventories also include the data collected by public bodies that cannot be published as open data (e.g. in relation to the EU Data Governance Act (EU) 2022/868)? 

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly specify.";yes;"As pointed out in the previous answer, public actors (and private actors who carry out a public service mission) have to publish in open data the inventory of administrative documents that they produce as part of their public service missions. This includes data that cannot be published as open data.

Ministries are working on data inventories in order to list all data within their perimeter. These inventories are based on metadata, and will include data that cannot be published as open data. Inventories themselves will be published as open data.

The interministerial catalogation tool will allow users to flag whether each dataset is available as open data (providing a link to the dataset on data.gouv.fr), whether it can be opened but is not yet available, or whether it cannot be published as open data.

The French strategy for data belonging to public bodies that cannot be published as open data is to make them available via API to authorised organisations (“droit d’en connaître”). The catalogue [api.gouv.fr](https://api.gouv.fr/) showcase both open and closed APIs. The roadmap of the API portal is totally transparent [https://api.gouv.fr/feuille-de-route](https://api.gouv.fr/feuille-de-route). In order to facilitate the management of data access authorizations, Etalab developed a tool called DataPass [https://datapass.api.gouv.fr/](https://datapass.api.gouv.fr/).

**Following the adoption of the 3DS law previously mentioned, the role assumed by the [catalogue.data.gouv.fr](http://catalogue.data.gouv.fr) platform is inevitably going to grow. Indeed, this catalog will also serve as a valuable tool in the context of exchanges between administrations, now strongly encouraged through incentives to use APIs with this new law.**";The Data Governance Act (EU) 2022/868 seeks to increase trust in data sharing, strengthen mechanisms to increase data availability and overcome technical obstacles to the reuse of data. It also aims to support the set-up and development of common European data spaces in strategic domains, involving both private and public players, in sectors such as health, environment, energy, agriculture, mobility, finance, manufacturing, public administration and skills. The Data Governance entered into force on 23 June 2022 and, following a 15-month grace period, will be applicable from September 2023. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R0868;;;;10

These datasets are provided by institutions such as IGN, Insee, or CSTB, which are encouraged to work towards opening their data.

**Explorer tool**

As previously mentioned, the data.gouv team also led an overhaul of the previsualization system and the implementation of a data explorer tool.** (https://explore.data.gouv.fr/) 

This prototype aims to make it easier to explore the data referenced on [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) without having to download the datasets. One of the best advantage to retire from this tool is to get an idea of the content and quality of a dataset before using it. In its current version, the explorer allows to select a file of less than 100Mb on [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) and to explore it directly on the national portal.**

For instance, this tool is applicable to :

- Summary of indicators for monitoring the COVID-19 dataset : (https://explore.data.gouv.fr/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.data.gouv.fr%2Ffr%2Fdatasets%2Fr%2F5c4e1452-3850-4b59-b11c-3dd51d7fb8b5)

**The creation of a DataLab**

The French Minister of Civil Service and Public Transformation announced in December 2022 the creation of a “DataLab”, an incubator for data-related projects within the DINUM, which will accelerate data projects thanks to material, technical, human and legal assistance. The datalab is a new element of a long-standing approach that consists of taking advantage of the development and exploitation of data held by the administration to put them at the service of projects that have an impact on citizens, public agents and businesses. It will thus help overcome the obstacles frequently encountered by administrations in their projects. In a full coherency with the creation of this new structure, a funding window has also been opened to support and cofinance this type of data-driven projects in the Ministries.

**At the state level**

Etalab, which is part of the Interministerial Directorate for Digital Affairs (DINUM), coordinates different actions:

- **Internal to the administration:** The Prime Minister, in his circular of April 2021, asked each ministry to appoint a CDO, Etalab is in charge of animating this network of ministerial CDOs and open data officers. The latter have themselves developed a network of correspondents within the operators of the ministry concerned. This network makes it possible to include all central government stakeholders in the open data awareness and training process. It also makes it possible to track needs (data needs, formation needs etc.) from the different ministries’ divisions in order for Etalab to trigger appropriate actions. A data policy roadmap per ministry has been published, together with an interministerial roadmap including a reflection on data governance and the inclusion of different stakeholders.
- **External to the administration:** Etalab regularly organizes (every 1 to 2 months) events that bring together civil society, associations, NGOs, and companies to work on the subject of open data. These events can take many forms such as hackathons that engage actors to discover and exploit databases published in open data. Ministries are involving various external stakeholders in the drafting of the ministerial roadmaps, for example the green tech actors for the Ministry of Ecological Transition, the Health Data Hub for the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The figure of ""ombudsman for general interest data"" planned in the Prime Minister circular of April 2021 will be focused on working together with private actors that make data that is deemed to be of general interest. The PM circular also mentions how the Open Government Partnership will be the privileged forum for exchanges between public actors and civil society.

On top of that, data.gouv.fr is conceived as an exchange platform with and between stakeholders (see previous question).

**At the local level**

The State and Etalab subsidize and coordinate Open Data France's actions on the territory. Open Data France is an association that has the mission to gather and support local authorities actively engaged in an approach to open public data and to promote all the steps taken by these authorities to promote open data. This is reflected in the implementation of a service offer adapted to each territory (awareness, training, accommodation, stimulation). This anchoring at the territorial level makes it possible to include a large number of stakeholders willing to commit themselves to the implementation of the open data policy.";;;;;30

For justification:
*  Could you briefly describe why this model was chosen/works best for your country?";top-down;"Etalab is piloting the open data strategy and is positioning itself as a facilitator for every stakeholder. Ministerial Chief Data Officers, as established by the Prime Minister Circular, are in charge of elaborating the data strategy in each ministry, of coordinating with the various stakeholders and to act as the main point of contact for data re-users. Such model is also replicated at local level with the data referents for each regional préfet.

This model is coherent with the French centralised administrative structure, and has proven to be the most effective. Nonetheless, there is a high degree of coordination with various stakeholders, including civil society, as mentioned in the previous question.";;;;;N/A

For justification:
* If yes, please give an example of what kind of support.

Etalab assists data providers with their open data publication process in several ways:

1. In order to improve data quality, Etalab is supports data producers in opening their data and publishing it on the national open data portal data.gouv.fr. This notably involves the publication of [guides](https://guides.etalab.studio/). These guides cover legal, technical or organisational themes. Etalab also provides support to publishers through one-to-one calls to help them prepare their dataset for publication and publish them on data.gouv.fr. We also publish extensive specific [documentation](https://doc.data.gouv.fr/) concerning the usage of the data.gouv.fr portal.
2. Etalab offers personalized support to all producers wishing to publish their data in open data. To this end, Etalab provides its expertise in the identification of databases eligible for open data, in improving the quality of these databases and in the publication process on [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr). For example, Etalab has supported the Ministry of Health, the public health authority Santé publique France, and other national health bodies during the entire COVID-19 pandemic. Etalab helped these actors to develop and implement an open data strategy over several stages concerning COVID-19 data, providing legal and technical support, hosting the data on data.gouv.fr and organising exchanges with re-users.
3. Etalab assists every user on data.gouv.fr thanks to the discussion section. See an [example](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/cadastre/) here. Moreover, a support tool has been put in place at [https://support.data.gouv.fr/](https://support.data.gouv.fr/) with guided paths for users to find the answer to frequently asked questions and to contact the appropriate support channels through an online form. All of Etalab's teams use a ticket management tool that enables them to respond more efficiently to different requests.

**At the local level**

At the local level, the Open Data France association (subsidised by the State) supports local authorities and other stakeholders in publishing their data in an open format. The association provides resources to help local governments implement an open data strategy:

- [Documents Opendata France](http://www.opendatafrance.net/ressources/documents-opendata-france/) :
- [OpenDataLocale – Accompagnement des collectivités à l'ouverture des données publiques](http://opendatalocale.net/)

However, Etalab assists local public authorities when they ask for it and coordinate actions to foster collaboration and interoperability between them. Here is two interesting example :

- The organisation of the [DataFin hackathon](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/hackathon-datafin-participez-a-lexploitation-des-donnees-financieres-des-collectivites-locales) on local government financial data;
- The [Covid Hackathon](https://hackathon-covid.fr/);
- The tool [schema.data.gouv.fr](http://www.schema.data.gouv.fr/), a referencing and support service for the creation of public data schemas that was designed notably for local collectivities. This tool enables data providers to produce high-quality data.

**2022 was marked by strong investments in local and regional open data initiatives and justified the organisation of a “Territories and Digital Day”. On this occasion was announced a strengthening of the digital transformation of territories lined by the organisation of several political committees dedicated to the find some new ways to amplify all the local and regional initiatives in this area.**

15;"To what degree do local/regional public bodies conduct open data initiatives? 

For justification:
* If not applicable, please explain why.";all public bodies;"By law, every local authority with more than 3 500 inhabitants and more than 50 employees falls under national open data obligations.

Local and regional public bodies in France who publish open data have their own open data portal and/or a designated account on the national portal data.gouv.fr with some data already published.

Many have their own open data platform (automatically harvested by the national one). Here are some examples:

Cities : Paris (https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/?sort=modified), Rennes (https://data.rennesmetropole.fr/page/home/), Lyon (https://data.grandlyon.com/), Lille (http://opendata.regionpaca.fr/), Nantes (http://data.nantes.fr/), Bordeaux (http://opendata.bordeaux.fr/), Grenoble (http://data.metropolegrenoble.fr/) ...

Regions : Provence-Alpes-Côtes-d’Azur (http://opendata.regionpaca.fr/), Loire Atlantique (http://data.loire-atlantique.fr/), Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (http://opendata.auvergnerhonealpes.eu/)

Department : Hérault (https://www.herault-data.fr/pages/accueil/), Morbihan (https://www.opendata56.fr/pages/home/) ...

The association OpenDataFrance manages an observatory that aims at listing all local open data initiatives [https://www.observatoire-opendata.fr](https://www.observatoire-opendata.fr/). The list of the initiatives is available here [https://airtable.com/shrKrV6KY7BlhHDx7](https://airtable.com/shrKrV6KY7BlhHDx7).

The list identifies more than 250 local and regional open data portals for more than 1060 local actors, including 850 local authorities (regions, departments, cities, metropolitan areas, groups of cities, etc.). This observatory confirms a French trend marked by a regular increase of approximately 150 local authorities per year, i.e. an increase of 18%, underlining the vitality and attractiveness of the practices of opening and circulating data at all levels and in all French territories. Moreover, it is possible to consider that all the local authorities have already been brought to collaborate within the framework of the national strategy in terms of open data, and more especially the communes (local administrative units) notably on the occasion of the publication in open data of the data relative to the elections and accessible on the national portal. In the same way, all French local authorities must contribute to the gathering of addresses from municipalities to constitute the national address database open to the public.

18;"Does the governance model include the appointment of official roles in civil services that are dedicated to open data (e.g. open data officers)?

For justification:
* If yes, please describe how this task is fulfilled at public body level.";yes;"Three types of actors are appointed within ministries:

- **Chief data officers** are proactively appointed by ministries, as asked by the Prime Minister in his April 2021 circular. They are in charge of the data policy within their ministries. The CDO is under the responsibility of the ""General Data Administrator"", the state CDO. Etalab leads this network and supports each CDO in the implementation of its missions, including the opening and circulation of its data. The list of CDOs is available in open data (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/liste-des-administrateurs-ministeriels-des-donnees/)
- **Open data officers:** although the role is not mandatory, since open data is a prerogative of the CDO, some ministries and inter-ministerial services choose to appoint open data officers alongside the CDOs, with the specific role of managing the open data policy within their structure. The open data officer's missions are to prioritise which datasets to open, to act as an intermediary between Etalab and the divisions of his ministry and to report needs and feedback to the CDO.
- **Data stewards :** although their role is not mandatory, data stewards are appointed by some ministerial directions to reinforce the publication of public data by some public administrations and their re-use by services of the direction.

The DINUM also coordinates a network of API managers in different public bodies.

At the local level, the Prime Minister circular of April 2021 asks every regional representative of the national government (Préfet) to nominate a referent for data, algorithms and source codes, in order to support local state services.";;;;;20

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe how this exchange takes place and provide evidence supporting your answer (e.g. meeting agendas, URLs to news items).";yes;"**The CDO network**

The aforementioned CDO network makes it possible to include all central government stakeholders in the open data awareness and training process. It also makes it possible to track needs (data needs, formation needs etc.) from the different ministries’ division to Etalab to trigger appropriate actions. The CDO network formally gathers at regular occasions (every trimester) in order to share about their progress, difficulties and good practices over data strategy in general. The issue of open data is of  course at the center of the discussions. Moreover, one-to-one exchanges between Etalab and the ministerial CDOs and open data officers take place regularly.

**Open Data France**

The association Open Data France aims at bringing together and supporting local authorities actively engaged in a process of opening up public data, and encouraging all the steps taken by these authorities with a view to promoting open data. Open Data France regularly organises meetings to exchange knowledge and experience with local actors in the field of open data. **For instance, in 2022, Etalab was frequently associated to many meetings and committees with Open Data France, especially on the question of the co-construction of the future of open data in territories.**

The central open data team within Etalab is also strongly committed to exchanging knowledge with other actors. Some examples include:

- Participating in the events of the French Information Industry Grouping (Groupement français de l'industrie de l'information) and their working group on open data (http://www.gfii.fr/fr/groupe/diffusion-des-donnees-publiques)
- Exchanging with data producers and re-users before the implementation of data schemas and their publishing on schema.data.gouv.fr. An example of discussion is available here (https://github.com/etalab/schema.data.gouv.fr/issues/214)
- Exchanging with users of the portal [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr) and gathering feedback on the features and UX of the portal. A group of beta testers has also been set up.
- **Etalab also organizes some ""démonstrations publiques"" (public demonstrations) to present to the public, on the occasion of a state of the art, its latest progress, especially on the national portal [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/). These demonstrations are also an additional opportunity for public agents to collect feedback from data reusers and data providers.**";Exchanges can take place via formal formats (e.g. round-tables, conferences) or less formal formats (e.g. meet-ups).;;;;20

For justification:
* If yes, please provide the URL and briefly highlight the key aspects covered. ";yes;"At the central government level, the main planning tool is the list of key datasets to open that has been established during the 5th interministerial committee of public transformation in february 2021. The plan is available here (https://ouverture.data.gouv.fr/).

In the same way, a similar planning tool will soon include the various datasets targeted into the HVDs implementation regulation.

Besides this central planning tool, ministries have their own publication plans in their roadmaps for data, algorithms and source codes. The roadmaps can be consulted here (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/feuilles-de-route-ministerielles-sur-la-politique-de-la-donnee-des-algorithmes-et-des-codes-sources/) and a consolidated list of actions is available here (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/liste-des-actions-prises-par-les-ministeres-dans-le-cadre-des-feuilles-de-routes-ministerielles/).";For data publication plans we refer to the existence of a specific workflow or internal data management process for publication of datasets. ;;;;20

For justification:
* If yes, please specify the process(es).";yes;"Data, algorithms and source codes policy is coordinated at the interministerial level by the Interministerial Directorate for Digital Affairs (Direction interministérielle du numérique, DINUM). The director of the DINUM is the Chief Data, Algorithms and Source Codes Officer (Administrateur général des données, algorithmes et codes sources, AGDAC). In order to coordinate this policy, a series of dedicated committees have been established and are led by the Etalab department :

- Interministerial councils of the chief data officers of each ministry (Comité interministériel des administrateurs des données, CIAD), every six months. These meetings have been institutionalised with the Prime Ministerial circular of 27 April 2021 on data, algorithms and source code policy.
- Quarterly steering committees.
- Regular bilateral exchanges with the ministries.

The agendas of these meetings includes an update on data policy (including open government data), a review of commitments made in the ministerial roadmaps, feedbacks from ministries, and general discussions. 

A series of seminars has been recently established by Etalab to encourage exchanges among ministerial CDOs, statistical services and Etalab members, to share practices and analyse challenges related to opening data. The first seminar took place in May 2022.

The platform [ouverture.data.gouv.fr](http://ouverture.data.gouv.fr/) also sets a public monitoring system to control the progress made in implementing the roadmaps on the open data component. It allows anyone to quickly and simply check which open data commitments have been made by the ministries and whether they have been fulfilled within the allotted time. It allows to strongly encourage ministries to fulfill their commitments under the threat of a public sanction of the ""name and shame"" type.";;;;;15

Having formal documents that point out the commitments, dedicated committees to monitor the implementation of the roadmaps, a team within Etalab that is in contact with data producers daily, and open data correspondants in each public sector organisation, all contribute to an effective implementation of the overall data strategy. We would describe the status as satisfactory, acknowledging nonetheless room for improvement in some fields such as civil servants’ training, community animation, and overcoming legal barriers in opening key datasets.";;;;;N/A
23a;"Are there any processes in place to asses if public sector bodies are charging for data above marginal cost? (please see directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information).

For justification:
* If yes, please specify the process(es).";yes;"French law states that the re-use of public information is free of charge by principle (see Article L. 324-1 of the Code of relations between the public and the administration (CRPA)).
As an exception, fees can only be charged in two cases:
- For administrations whose main activity consists of collecting, producing, making available or disseminating public information, when less than 75% of the costs related to this main activity are covered by tax revenues, endowments or subsidies (i.e. at least 25% by own revenues). For the State's administrations (including its public administrative establishments), a strict list of data likely to be subject to a re-use fee is published (D. 324-5-1 CRPA).
- For public libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives, only for information resulting from digitisation operations of their holdings and collections and, where applicable, the information associated with them, when the latter are jointly marketed (art. L. 324-2 CRPA). In short, royalties may only relate to the re-use of digitised image files and their metadata (if they are re-used jointly with them); royalties may not relate to natively digital documents.
All fees previously collected that do not comply with the legal framework now in force can no longer be claimed.
The amount of the fees shall be set according to objective, transparent, verifiable and non-discriminatory criteria. The amount shall be reviewed at least every five years. The details of its calculation shall be published in electronic form jointly on the website of the administration concerned and on data.gouv.fr.

Etalab is in charge of assessing whether the amount of the fees charged by State administrations is appropriate. The list of State bodies that can charge a fee is again published by decree, hence an eventual modification goes through a strict review process in which Etalab is involved.

In 2018, the Court of Audit (Cour des comptes) issued a summary report to Prime Minister Édouard Philippe pointing out the issues related to the economic models of three State operators charging for data and the consequences of opening such data. (https://www.ccomptes.fr/system/files/2019-03/20190311-refere-S2018-3287-valorisation-donnees-IGN-Meteo-France-Cerema.pdf).

Prime Minister Philippe replied in 2019 (https://www.ccomptes.fr/sites/default/files/2019-03/20190311-refere-S2018-3287-valorisation-donnees-IGN-Meteo-France-Cerema-rep-PM.pdf) deciding to generalising the opening of data produced by the national geographical institute IGN and Météo-France. Prime Minister Castex, in his April 2021 circular (https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/circulaire/id/45162) reiterated the aim of extinguishing fees by 2023. The Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOM) met the commitment and stopped charging fees.

For justification:
* Please briefly describe.";N/A;"As stated above, despite the overall high level of open data maturity of all public sector organisations at national and local level, there is room for improvement in some key areas:

- Data literacy of civil servants and training in open data skills. This has been pointed out by the Open Data Mission carried out by MP Éric Bothorel (https://www.vie-publique.fr/sites/default/files/rapport/pdf/277879.pdf). The need for skills and expertise in the field of data has also been the object of a specific mission carried out by the DINUM and the national statistical institute INSEE (https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/publication-du-rapport-dinum-insee-12-recommandations-pour-dynamiser-la-gestion-et-la-valorisation-des-competences-data/) which formulates 12 recommendations.
- Although the law states that all data must be open by default, the existence of this right is not widely known among the general population, civil servants that do not work directly on data are not always trained on how to respond to access-to-information requests, and there are no sanctions for the public bodies that do not comply. The aforementioned open data mission underlined the need to improve the right of access to data and the role of the independent authority that supervises this right, the Commission for Access to Administrative Documents (Commission d’accès aux documents administratifs, CADA).
- Fragmentation of efforts and discoverability of data. Public sector organisations at national and local level are rather independent in the implementation of their own open data strategy, and local authorities are not obliged to publish data on the national portal [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr). The main advantage of this configuration is agility and the possibility to accommodate different degrees of competence and needs. The downside is the fragmentation of efforts and the difficulty to centralise data on the national portal. Having to develop harvesters from other open data portals to data.gouv.fr, setting up the harvesting pipeline, managing the content on both a ministerial/local portal and the national one is a challenge for both Etalab managing the national portal and the other actors.";;;;;N/A

* If yes, please briefly describe the measures that you have adopted or plan to adopt to cope with these challenges. 
* If no, please specifiy what is hampering finding a strategic approach to solve these challenges.";yes;" - To address the challenges related to skills, both the Open Data Mission report and the DINUM/INSEE report point out several recommendations. Many activities proposed by these reports are already in place: the website [https://metiers.numerique.gouv.fr/](https://metiers.numerique.gouv.fr/) to centralise job offers in the digital field in the public sector, improved HR procedures, a stronger interministerial coordination between the DINUM and the ministerial statistical offices to share knowledge and best practices, the 10% programme [https://10pourcent.etalab.studio/](https://10pourcent.etalab.studio/).
- In 2022, DINUM, in collaboration with the Ministry of the Armed Forces, also organized the 3rd edition of the ""Vis mon job"" operation. During this event, volunteer digital professionals within the State services (central administration, operator, public establishment or decentralized service) have made discover their job and their daily life to students by becoming ambassadors of the State's digital jobs.
(https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/actualites/vis-mon-job-2022-agents-etat-faites-decouvrir-votre-metier-numerique-a-des-etudiants/)
- To improve data discoverability and the centralisation of data in the national portal, the Prime Minister reiterated the need to publish data on [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr) in his circular of April 2021. Etalab continuously works to improve the harvesters (from CKAN https://github.com/opendatateam/udata-ckan), the proprietary solution opendatasoft (https://github.com/opendatateam/udata-ods), and DCAT catalogues (https://github.com/opendatateam/udata/tree/master/udata/harvest).
- To improve the access to administrative documents, the association Ma Dada (madada.fr) helps citizens send official access-to-information requests. The association got selected in the first promotion of the Citizen Initiative Accelerator (Accélérateur d’Initiatives Citoyennes, AIC), a programme led by Etalab and the Interministerial Directorate for Public Transformation (Direction interministérielle de la transformation publique, DITP) that helps initiatives from civil society to carry out projects of general interest. The accelerator will help Ma Dada coordinate their actions with the independent authority in charge of access-to-information (the CNIL) and other relevant actors.

**In 2023, the Etalab team is also working on a global overhaul of the guides in order to keep providing more synthetic and accessible informations on a single entry point.** 

Moreover, a dedicated team within Etalab is in charge of assisting data providers with the process of opening data and publishing it on the platform. The team is routinely in contact with all public data providers, and can be contacted through the online support form (https://support.data.gouv.fr/).

Also, the association Open Data France published a “kit of methodological and pedagogical resources” to assist local authorities with their open data publication process (https://www.opendatafrance.net/ressources/documents-opendata-france/). Every year, the association holds [“The month of data”](https://opendatafrance.gitbook.io/le-mois-de-la-data/) (”Le mois de la data”), a series of webinars concerning data, targeting local public authorities.";E.g. a task force/agency that is in charge of promoting and assisting the data publication process at national and/or regional and local levels (where applicable).;;;;15

Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

28;"Do you have a definition of open data reuse in your country?
 
For justification:
* If yes, please specify it.";yes;"In France, according to a broad definition that is commonly accepted, “reuse” refers to the use of public data by third parties for purposes other than the public service mission for which the data was produced or received (this definition has been recalled here : (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/posts/nos-reflexions-sur-les-reutilisations-des-donnees-ouvertes/).

This definition stems from the Code of Relations between the Public and the Administration : “Public information contained in documents communicated or published by the administrations mentioned in the first paragraph of article L. 300-2 may be used by any person who wishes to do so for purposes other than those of the public service mission for which the documents were produced or received.” (https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000033219044). This definition is similar to the PSI Directive definition : “Public sector bodies collect, produce, reproduce and disseminate documents in order to fulfil their public service mission. The use of these documents for other purposes constitutes re-use.”

The complexity and the need to clarify the definition of reuse has been emphasised in the literature, particularly with respect to research data, a key issue being the distinction between use and reuse.

Besides that definition, more restrictive approaches have also emerged : some consider that only perennial uses of data are reuses while others consider any use of data as reuse.

In our day to day operations, any exploitation of data in order to obtain information is considered as reuse, whether this exploitation is freely accessible or not : following that definition, a use of private data or a data journalist’s work to prepare for an investigation will be considered as reuse.";;;;;10
29;"Is there interest at national level to observe the level of reuse of open data in your country?
 
For justification:
* If yes, what activities/efforts have you observed within public bodies that support your observation?";Yes, there is a strong focus;"There is a strong interest in France in observing the level of open data re-use.

Etalab continuously conducts reuse assessment work, namely by measuring usage statistics (https://stats.data.gouv.fr/), by keeping track on the reuses referenced on the [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) portal (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/reuses/) or by interviewing data producers and reusers on reuse works. Such interest is demonstrated by a 2022 study on the measurement of open data reuse in France : (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/a61e1fcc-cd61-46bd-a6c5-af94cb9f8459).

In the same way, the study previously mentioned reveals French administrations’ growing interest and efforts in observing the reuses stemming from their open data (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/a61e1fcc-cd61-46bd-a6c5-af94cb9f8459) : p.24-25). The investigation also showed that administrations are seeking to learn from the impact measurement methods used by other public bodies. Indeed, getting to know more about the level of reuse of their open data allows them to develop a more relevant open data offer, better adapted to demand through two mechanisms : it helps them improve data quality on one hand and motivate continued and strengthened efforts to open data on the other. Administrations also want to know about data reuse from other organisations, the private sector, NGOs, civil society, etc. These reuses inspire them to develop or improve their own services.

From this perspective, administrations want to understand which data is most reused, for what purpose and by whom. There is also a strong desire to create communities of reusers in order to monitor data reuse over time and to collect the needs in terms of data or quality. Administrations are also encouraged to do so : in his circular n°6264/SG (https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/circulaire/id/45162), the Prime Minister formally asked all ministers to “animate the ecosystems of re-users” of their ministries’ data, in order to identify high value-added datasets.

This can be illustrated for example by the 18th action of the data roadmap of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEFR) (https://www.economie.gouv.fr/files/files/PDF/2020/20200325-fdr-202021-Bercy-data.pdf : p.17)

*Animate an open data community (action 18) (20S1) Despite more than 365 datasets opened by the MEFR's departments and services on the portal [data.economie.gouv.fr](http://data.economie.gouv.fr/), it remains difficult to listen to the users of this data, due to the lack of an organized and representative community that is organized and representative of the possible uses. To remedy this, the MEFR's Secretary General is initiating a community that brings together data producers and users. An annual ""non-conference"" type meeting is proposed at the end of the year and gives the floor to the members of the community. The work that will be done will be proposed by the participants and not listed in the by the participants and not listed in advance by the MEFR directorates.*

Another example can be given by the roadmap of the Ministry of Public Transformation and Public Service (MTFP) (https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/uploads/feuillederoute_MTFP.pdf#page=22&zoom=100,92,674) : p.24)

*Action A26: Promote the uses of open data and provide tools for dialogue between producers and reusers in a logic of impact.*

*Efforts to understand and promote the uses of open data must be continued in order to provide concrete examples of reuse, inspire other uses and to measure and demonstrate real impacts. The MTFP is committed to providing data producers with better visibility of the interest in their data, by improving the readability of data usage and download statistics, and by encouraging reusers to reference their use cases. Efforts to support reusers in sharing their work, and to tell the story of the best uses of open data will be continued, and places for exchange between reusers and producers will be developed, through the development of new features on [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) and the animation of its communities by each producer.*

To respond to these demands to measure data re-use, Etalab is renewing its support strategy towards data providers:

In the same way that Etalab supports data producers in the opening of their data, it must continue to support the appropriation of this data by third parties. The aim is to empower data producers in the promotion of their data and in the animation of the community of reusers. Among the actions that Etalab has identified: **Action 1: Develop a culture of open data reuse: understand and promote the understanding of use cases** Etalab must propose a catalogue of use cases, broken down by public policy, evolving over time. A particular effort must be made to understand the uses of quality data sets, first and foremost the data sets of the Public Data Service.

**Action 2: Support data producers in the valorisation of their data and the animation of the community** Extend the notion of data literacy beyond data production, including data valorisation and community animation. These services will be based in particular on a tailored support for selecting which data to promote, get in contact with relevant communities, sharing of best practices, organisation of events, etc.";"With 'national level' we refer to either central government, federal government, or top ministries.
Examples of such activities could be regular information sessions and/or promotion of published data at conferences and other events. ";;;;15
30;"Are there any processes in place to monitor the level of reuse of your country's open data, for example via the national open data portal?
 
For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe these processes and provide the URLs to support the answer.";yes;"In France, quantitative and qualitative processes have been implemented to grasp the level of open data re-use :

- The monitoring of datasets metrics through the national open data portal [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) : datasets visit and download metrics as well as the metrics on reuses published are tracked to understand which datasets are the most popular and to follow popularity dynamics (https://stats.data.gouv.fr/). We are currently working on a new interface to showcase those metrics but also trends and dynamics : [http://activites-datagouv.app.etalab.studio/](http://activites-datagouv.app.etalab.studio/)
- The monitoring of reuses referenced on the national open data portal [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) ([https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/reuses/)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/reuses/)) : reusers are encouraged to publish their reuse work linked to a dataset, and their publications are monitored by the [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) team on a daily basis and also allow data producers to have visibility on the reuses developed from their open data. To this day, more than 3 000 reuses have been shared on the [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) portal and we are working on engaging more reusers to publish their work in order to track them better, for example with a custom user flow : [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/onboarding/reutilisateurs/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/onboarding/reutilisateurs/)
- Interviews with data producers and data reusers : the [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) team regularly interviews data producers and data reusers to identify emblematic reuses on important datasets and gather information about them.

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe these activities/incentives and provide the URLs to support the answer. ";yes;"Public bodies are highly encouraged to monitor the re-use of their own published data.

First, while helping data producers in opening their data, Etalab strongly advocates for the monitoring of one’s published data, emphasising the benefits of doing so. Parts of our arguments are available here : (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/posts/quel-suivi-des-usages-des-donnees-ouvertes/).

Etalab’s strategy for the monitoring of reuses is one where we aim to empower data producers in doing so. Therefore, our efforts are dedicated to providing them with the help to measure reuse, thus incentivising them :

- We provide them with tools, namely metrics and notifications on new reuses published (https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/catalogue-des-donnees-de-data-gouv-fr/), and we are today working on making them even more accessible to them : https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antonin-garrone-8272bb154_nous-sommes-en-train-de-travailler-sur-la-activity-7043991572467601409-LvWL/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop.
- We provide them with methodological guidelines on how to measure reuse : https://etalab-2.gitbook.io/guides/publier-des-donnees/guide-qualite/ameliorer-la-qualite-dun-jeu-de-donnees/connaitre-et-suivre-les-usages-dun-jeu-de-donnees

To deepen this approach, we interviewed data producers to understand how we can better help them follow their open data reuses. Insights are in this study : https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/a61e1fcc-cd61-46bd-a6c5-af94cb9f8459.

We also have programs that promote the measurement of reused data.

Etalab supports administrations in measuring data that is reused on a daily basis. In addition, specific programs for transforming public administration through data enable the importance of open data to be introduced and the need to measure reuse :

- The program “[Entrepreneurs d’intérêt général](https://entrepreneur-interet-general.etalab.gouv.fr/)” creates new opportunities to hire civil servants with high level digital skills within the administration, to improve public service mission and to transmit new skills in public organisation. The proposed challenges are often based on the use of data to better implement public policies. Many challenges have an open data component. In this perspective, the EIG programme emphasises the need to monitor the reuse of open data.
- The “Lab IA” program assists administrations in the use of their data thanks to data sciences and artificial intelligence. Some of the projects have an open data component. In this perspective, the programme emphasises the need to monitor the reuse of open data.";Incentives could for example be training, financial incentives, or awards.;;;;20

For justification:
* If yes, how do you define the impact of open data in your country? 
* If possible, please provide a URL to a public document describing it.";yes;"The Open Data Mission led by MP Eric Bothorel defines four impact areas for open data : scientific as a vector of knowledge, economical as a driver of innovation, democratic to improve public service and political to restore people’s confidence in public action (https://www.gouvernement.fr/upload/media/default/0001/01/2020_12_rapport_-_pour_une_politique_publique_de_la_donnee_-_23.12.2020_.pdf) : p.22-23). This view is in line with the ministerial strategy on open data, which is focused on openness i.e. more public open data to foster innovation and transparency, to enhance the external evaluation of governmental policy and the democratic debate. In this regard, the final report of the Open Data Mission recommends to assess the economical, social and scientific impact of the opening and sharing of data and source codes (https://www.gouvernement.fr/upload/media/default/0001/01/2020_12_rapport_-_pour_une_politique_publique_de_la_donnee_-_23.12.2020_.pdf) : p.13).

The vision previously detailed is embraced within Etalab, as we consider that open data impact is manifold and can be measured through different ways.

The four impact areas can be translated in three kind of audiences :

- Administrations that improve the delivery of public services
- Citizens who benefit from greater transpaency
- Companies, NGOs, researchers, etc. who use data to gain knowledge and create new innovative products and services.

As a final remark, the impact of open data can be measured both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a complementary way : we thus carry out both an analysis of quantitative metrics on our national open data portal data.gouv.fr and of qualitative impact by interviewing portal users, data producers and reusers.

In the official interministerial data administration framework (https://static.data.gouv.fr/resources/politique-publique-de-la-donnee-des-algorithmes-et-des-codes-sources-15-feuilles-de-route-ministerielles/20210927-160143/cadre-interministeriel-donnee.pdf), the interministerial director for digital affairs outlines the vision and challenges of data-driven public action. Data is said to be « the strategic asset of the digital revolution », and its impact on public action is broken down into five areas : transparency, production of better public services, efficacy, supportiveness, creation of economic value.

At the request of the Prime Minister, an unprecedented mobilisation has taken place in all ministries about data, algorithms and source codes : together, within a shared interministerial framework, each ministry has defined its strategy in this area and has broken it down into a plan of concrete actions to be implemented over a period of 2 to 3 years. The 15 ministerial roadmaps on data, algorithms and source codes are available here (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/politique-publique-de-la-donnee-des-algorithmes-et-des-codes-sources-15-feuilles-de-route-ministerielles/) and the list of actions decided by the ministries in the framework of the ministerial roadmaps is available in open data here (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/liste-des-actions-prises-par-les-ministeres-dans-le-cadre-des-feuilles-de-routes-ministerielles/).

34;"Do you have a methodology in place to measure the impact of open data in your country?
 
For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the key points of this methodology.";yes;"Etalab has developed a systematic impact assessment methodology. This methodology proposes to estimate the impact of open data by examining four different levels or layers :

- First level : raw data itself : number of datasets published, downloaded, etc. For this first level, we analyse visits to dataset pages, datasets downloads, etc. by using data.gouv.fr metrics available on [stats.data.gouv.fr](http://www.stats.data.gouv.fr/). We are then able identify datasets with the highest impact and the ones that are highly demanded. The [data.gouv.fr dataset catalogue](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/catalogue-des-donnees-de-data-gouv-fr/) also provides visibility on published datasets with their associated metadata and metrics. This provides a more global knowledge on user behavior on the national platform.
- Second level : direct uses of the data : number of reuses on datasets. For this second level, we examine how many reuses are known for each dataset and their nature.
- Third level : indirect uses of raw data : usages of the reuses developed from open data. For this third level, we investigate how much open data reuses are themselves used (this is sometimes impossible to know).
- Fourth level : externalities : societal and economic impacts of open data. For this fourth level, we document the impacts on the datasets for which we have observed high impact in a structured assessment report : general description, reuser, value proposition, datasets used, partners involved, results, next steps and learnings, etc.

This methodology is presented and detailed in a working paper exploring how to measure open data impact : https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/a61e1fcc-cd61-46bd-a6c5-af94cb9f8459

We are continuously trying to improve this impact assessment methodology by integrating other countries’ best practices.

The COVID-19 crisis has been a catalyst for collaboration between government and civil society. Open data made it possible for impactful tools to be built, for example ViteMaDose [https://vitemadose.covidtracker.fr/](https://vitemadose.covidtracker.fr/) that checks for available slots in vaccination centres and is based on the list of said centres, pharmacists and GPs that administer vaccines. The development of the COVID-19 dashboard on the Government website was also a coordinated effort from different actors to create impact : [https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/comment-les-administrations-ont-collabore-a-louverture-des-donnees-du-coronavirus-le-cas-francais](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/comment-les-administrations-ont-collabore-a-louverture-des-donnees-du-coronavirus-le-cas-francais).

This action plan aims to create impact on important themes for French people : transparency of public action results, environmental issues, local public action, users at the heart of public action, citizen participation, digital inclusion, etc.

In 2022, Etalab has collaborated with Latitudes, a non-profit promoting « Tech for good », to design an « Open Data University » : [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/odu/home/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/odu/home/). This program, that aims at teaching higher education students how to reuse open data, provides teachers with high impact open data projects for their students to work on and create impact. This year, 5 projects on high value added datasets have been designed and led to impactful reuses :

In this study, we carried out the methodology described in question 34 of this questionnaire : we combined quantitative and qualitative approaches by both analysing data.gouv.fr metrics and interviewing with data producers and reusers. Impactful use cases on different impact areas have been identified, reviewed and researched, among which governmental impact. Data on the impact created by open data on governmental challenges is available in this working paper (p.29-30 ; p.40) : : [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/a61e1fcc-cd61-46bd-a6c5-af94cb9f8459](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/a61e1fcc-cd61-46bd-a6c5-af94cb9f8459).

For justification:
* If yes, please explain how and what kind of impact is created on the topic and provide examples of maximum 3 recent open data reuse cases in the form of research or application, whether developed by government or by civil society.";yes;"One of the main rationale for opening data from the public sector is the efficiency and effectiveness it brings to the government in delivering public services. As stated in the final report of the Open Data Mission, opening data remains the best way for public administrations to share information to citizens in an efficient and fast way, allowing for better public action : [https://www.gouvernement.fr/upload/media/default/0001/01/2020_12_rapport_-_pour_une_politique_publique_de_la_donnee_-_23.12.2020_.pdf](https://www.gouvernement.fr/upload/media/default/0001/01/2020_12_rapport_-_pour_une_politique_publique_de_la_donnee_-_23.12.2020_.pdf).

Before open data by default, the circulation of data between actors was timely and costly (before the Digital Republic Bill, administrations could charge the access to data between each other). By publishing data and making it available to anyone, all actors can now access data without asking for one’s permission. Circulation of data between administrations then fosters innovation and improves the efficiency of public services : processes can be accelerated, policy evaluation and impact assessment can be more precise and public policies can be inspired and supported by open data exploitation.

Several high impact use cases illustrate the impact of open data on the efficiency and effectiveness of government in delivering public services. These use cases have been researched and followed throughout the time, to keep on measuring their results.

**Use case 1 : French companies and associations registry**

Many public administrations need information on French companies and associations to carry out their support missions towards them (information to verify the existence of a legal person, certify its validity, etc.). Public officials can now easily and quickly access this information thanks to all open business related datasets and the high impact tool developed by Etalab : [https://annuaire-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/](https://annuaire-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/). Annuaire des Entreprises centralises all the open data related to legal persons that appear in the administration’s data and makes this consolidated information available to all, free of charge : [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/onboarding/annuaire-des-entreprises/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/onboarding/annuaire-des-entreprises/).

**Use case 2 : Publication of the energy performance diagnostic database**

The Energy Performance Diagnosis database ([https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/dpe-logements-existants-depuis-juillet-2021/)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/dpe-logements-existants-depuis-juillet-2021/)) provides information on the energy performance of a dwelling or a building by evaluating its energy consumption and its impact in terms of greenhouse emissions. Data is collected on the field by diagnosticians and sent to a centralizing body : ADEME. Each year, ADEME had to carry out customised data extractions according to various local players requests. These extractions could take more than ten days per year. With the publication of the databases in open data, ADEME agents no longer need to perform this extraction and can now concentrate on exploiting the data.

**Use case 3 : Powering/building public services and make them more efficient thanks to open data**

Open data is now a key ressource to build digital public services. Examples are numerous, but we can cite a few :

- Avril ([https://avril.pole-emploi.fr/)](https://avril.pole-emploi.fr/)), that is using data from the operational directory of occupations and jobs for a service allowing people to obtain a diploma from their professional skills
- Code du travail numérique ([https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/reuses/code-du-travail-numerique/)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/reuses/code-du-travail-numerique/)), that is using open data for a service facilitating access to labour law for companies and employees
- France Chaleur Urbaine ([https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/reuses/carte-france-chaleur-urbaine/)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/reuses/carte-france-chaleur-urbaine/)) that is using open data for a service accelerating the connection of buildings to heating networks.

These use cases have been researched and followed throughout the time, to keep on measuring their results.

**Use case 1 : Public finance data**

Open data has been used to design tools allowing for more transparency on public funds and a better appropriation of financial data by citizens, thus objectifying debates on local public policies as well as their financing.

During the « DataFin » hackathon based on data sets in open data : https://airtable.com/shrC4vYoq7F0wnDDu, several applications were built and are available [here](https://datafin.fr/) : https://datafin.fr/. Two projects based on open data were also launched through the General Interest Entrepreneurs programme ([https://eig.etalab.gouv.fr/)](https://eig.etalab.gouv.fr/)) to further maximise the impact for transparency and accountability :

- “[Contribute to the transparency of public funds committed for Olympics games in 2024](https://entrepreneur-interet-general.etalab.gouv.fr/defis/2020/datalympics.html) “
- “[Simplifying access to financial and statistical information for local authorities](https://entrepreneur-interet-general.etalab.gouv.fr/defis/2020/open-collectivites.html)”

Open data has been used to create a service allowing citizens to explore local government financial data with maps so as to understand it better : [https://data.ofgl.fr/pages/cartographie/](https://data.ofgl.fr/pages/cartographie/).

**Use case 2 : Aid to businesses allocated during the COVID-19 crisis**

In order to provide transparency and greater visibility on the aid to businesses allocated during the COVID-19 crisis, Etalab worked with the economic and financial ministries to consolidate and make available data on various types of aid ([https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/comment-les-administrations-ont-collabore-a-louverture-des-donnees-du-coronavirus-le-cas-francais)](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/comment-les-administrations-ont-collabore-a-louverture-des-donnees-du-coronavirus-le-cas-francais)) : data relating to the solidarity fund set up in the context of the COVID-19, data on state-guaranteed loans in the context of the COVID19, data on tax deferrals granted in the context of the COVID-19. Etalab then developed a dashboard that makes it possible to consult and visualise the different types of aid granted by the state to companies, bringing great transparency on the way the Government managed the crisis : [https://aides-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/](https://aides-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/).

**Use case 3 : Transparency of high salaries in the public service**

Pursuant to law No 2019-828 of 6 August 2019, ministerial departments, local authorities with more than 80 000 inhabitants and hospitals with a budget of more than 200 million euros must publish annually the sum of the 10 highest gross salaries, specifying the number of women and the number of men involved. In order to make it easier for these administrations to publish such data, following a public consultation with producers and reusers, Etalab built a data schema that makes it easier to aggregate these documents.  [https://schema.data.gouv.fr/etalab/schema-hautes-remunerations/latest.html](https://schema.data.gouv.fr/etalab/schema-hautes-remunerations/latest.html) [https://github.com/etalab/schema-hautes-remunerations](https://github.com/etalab/schema-hautes-remunerations)

Several datasets have been published on [data.gouv.fr](http://data.gouv.fr/) and allow for greater transparency :

- [Ministère de la Culture](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/5ed720621bca55ea7d179ef6/)

- [Département du Doubs](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/somme-des-dix-remunerations-les-plus-elevees/)

**Use case 4 : Publication of data related to public procurement**

According to French law, data on all public procurement contracts above 40 000 euros must be published in open data on the buyer’s profile.

The requirement for transparency and openness of public procurement data meets several objectives : it is likely to contribute to the prevention of and fight against corruption, to the good management of public funds, to the steering of purchasing policies and to the economic development of companies, which will be able to use this data either to better meet the needs of public purchasers or to develop new services to improve public procurement policies.

Data producers have to conform to a data schema [https://schema.data.gouv.fr/139bercy/format-commande-publique/latest.html](https://schema.data.gouv.fr/139bercy/format-commande-publique/latest.html) defined by law [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000038318675/](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000038318675/), in order to check the validity and the conformity of the files, and to make it easy to aggregate such data in a single dataset [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/5cd57bf68b4c4179299eb0e9/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/5cd57bf68b4c4179299eb0e9/)

Further information is available on the GitHub repo of the aggregation tool [https://github.com/139bercy/decp-rama](https://github.com/139bercy/decp-rama) and in the official documentation [https://139bercy.github.io/decp-docs/](https://139bercy.github.io/decp-docs/), both managed by the Ministry of the Economy.

**Use case 5 : France recovery plan following the COVID-19 crisis** 

In the framework of the Open Data University [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/odu/home/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/odu/home/), students have been asked to assess the extent to which the aid distributed by the State as part of the recovery plan has had an impact on economic activity and/or ecological transition in France : [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/odu/defi_france-relance/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/odu/defi_france-relance/)";;;;;15

These use cases have been researched and followed throughout the time, to keep on measuring their results.

**Use case 1 : Atlas Culture**

The « Atlas Culture des territoires » is a website designed as a reference resource for public data on culture in France : cultural places and offer, cultural public spending, cultural public policies, cultural companies, employment in the cultural field, etc. It has been built for cultural affairs officials, for them to better analyse the current situation and better design their territorial strategies for cultural development : [https://atlasculture.fr/](https://atlasculture.fr/).

**Use case 2 : The Barometer of results**

The Government developed the « Baromètre des résultats de l’action publique de l’Etat » (barometer of the results of the states’ public action), ([https://www.gouvernement.fr/les-actions-du-gouvernement/resultats)](https://www.gouvernement.fr/les-actions-du-gouvernement/resultats)) a tool allowing citizens and policymakers at any level to monitor the implementation of France’s main public policies. The barometer is powered by open data [available on data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/barometre-des-resultats-de-laction-publique/) : [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/barometre-des-resultats-de-laction-publique/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/barometre-des-resultats-de-laction-publique/).

Local state officials use the barometer every day to keep track on the evolution of the indicators in a specific territory, to define whether or not actions and policies need to be adapted. Providing a unique tool for 101 departments and 18 regions considerably increased the efficiency of governmental action at the local level. Civil society can also check the barometer and use the underlying open data to carry out analyses of the Government’s policies, as it has been done by the Terra Nova think thank : [https://tnova.fr/notes/barometre-des-resultats-de-l-action-publique-la-france-de-la-fibre-optique](https://tnova.fr/notes/barometre-des-resultats-de-l-action-publique-la-france-de-la-fibre-optique) [https://tnova.fr/notes/barometre-des-resultats-de-l-action-publique-france-services-des-lieux-au-service-du-public-dans-les-territoires](https://tnova.fr/notes/barometre-des-resultats-de-l-action-publique-france-services-des-lieux-au-service-du-public-dans-les-territoires)

**Use case 1 : Deciding on which companies to dedicate support and aid**

Open data on French companies has been used to design Signaux Faibles, a digital service that helps public officials target state support measures on companies in difficulty. Indeed, businesses difficulties are often discovered too late, when many public aids that could have enabled them to rebound are no longer actionable or less effective. The tool relies on the infrastructure of the SIRENE database of companies and their establishments, available in open data and allows to identify companies in difficulty as early as possible. It then becomes possible to support them early and thus participate in the prevention of failures ([https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/onboarding/signaux_faibles/)](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/onboarding/signaux_faibles/))

These use cases have been researched and followed throughout the time, to keep on measuring their results.

**Use case 1 : Determine one’s career orientation**

The Operational Directory of Occupatins and Jobs, available in open data, data on the labor market and data on job offers, available in open data, are used to build a service that allows young people to actively build their career orientation by discovering skills, interests and job opportunities : [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/onboarding/diagoriente/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/onboarding/diagoriente/)

**Use case 2 : Look for a job**

Open data on the labour market and on job offers are used to power the service La Bonne Boîte [https://labonneboite.pole-emploi.fr](https://labonneboite.pole-emploi.fr/), a tool that facilitates job search through algorithmic predictions uncovering the hidden job market (which represents 75% of job opportunities).

**Use case 3 : Find relevant training**

Open data on the labour market and employment is used to nurture La Bonne Formation, [https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/la-bonne-formation.html](https://beta.gouv.fr/startups/la-bonne-formation.html), a service that helps people find relevant training to be able to return to work, and find out about possible financing.

**Use case 4 : Get a diploma or a professional certification**

The Operational Directory of Occupations and Jobs, available in open data is used to power a service called Avril that allows people to obtain a diploma from their professional skills : [https://avril.pole-emploi.fr/](https://avril.pole-emploi.fr/).";;;;;20

These use cases have been researched and followed throughout the time, to keep on measuring their results. Open business-related data has become a key ressource for new companies and overall lower the cost of entry in the market for new entrepreneurs.

**Use case 1 : A service to help entrepreneurs in their administrative procedures**

Open business data is used by the service Annuaire des Entreprises [https://annuaire-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/](https://annuaire-entreprises.data.gouv.fr/) through which entrepreneurs can quickly retrieve their information and thus carry out their administrative procedures more easily (SIREN/SIRET, NAF/APE code, VAT number, etc.) : [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/onboarding/annuaire-des-entreprises/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/pages/onboarding/annuaire-des-entreprises/).

**Use case 2 : Place des entreprises**

Open business data is used to power a digital public service, Place des entreprises, that connects small sized and medium sized enterprises with the right contact person within the administration for personalised help and advice (human resources, labour law, financial difficulties, investment, commercial development, etc.) to help them develop their activity : [https://place-des-entreprises.beta.gouv.fr/](https://place-des-entreprises.beta.gouv.fr/).

**Use case 3 : Emphasize gender inequalities**

Open data is used in analyses shedding light on gender inequalities and, by doing so, might be contributing to its decrease. For example, the professional equality index, designed to advance equal pay between women and men within companies, was published in open data ([https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/index-egalite-professionnelle-f-h-des-entreprises-de-plus-de-250-salaries/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/index-egalite-professionnelle-f-h-des-entreprises-de-plus-de-250-salaries/)).

The opendata catalog of a community gathers the metadata description of the datasets it publishes. It can be generated automatically by the platform that hosts or harvests them. Several standards allow the standardization of the metadata of a catalog (INSPIRE for geographic data, DCAT and its variations for all types of open data), but local catalogs, when they exist, whether they are exposed via an API or extracted in the form of files, often depend on the technical capacity of the solution used and its configuration (different formats, more or less rich or extensive, depending on the platform, unique catalog and not for each producer when the platform is shared, distinction or not between datasets and resources, etc). Not to mention that many local authorities use simple websites to make their data available.

The specification of a simplified data model should make it possible to harmonize these local catalogs in a format accessible to all local authorities and facilitate their consolidation in a national inventory, the ""catalog of open local data catalogs"".

[See example](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/base-sirene-des-entreprises-et-de-leurs-etablissements-siren-siret/)

However it is very usefull for both data producers et data reusers to be able to attest quickly a dataset’s quality. To this end we developed a metadata quality score for dataset : [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/posts/un-nouveau-score-de-qualite-des-metadonnees-sur-les-jeux-de-donnees/](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/posts/un-nouveau-score-de-qualite-des-metadonnees-sur-les-jeux-de-donnees/)";For more information, please visit: http://5stardata.info/en/ or https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/W3C04.pdf.;;Answer in Q127 also applies here;;15
127;"Do you conduct activities to promote and familiarise data providers with ways to ensure higher quality data (such as promoting the model referenced in the previous question)?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe.";yes;"We developed a strategy on dataset quality inspired from the 5-star model :

**Licence** :

We developed our [own licence](https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ETALAB-Licence-Ouverte-v2.0.pdf) and provide [guidelines](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/licences) and guides on how to choose a licence and why (see previous questions).

**Reusability** :

With our focus on data literacy and the organisation of events, we foster the reusability of data by insisting notably on [quality of documentation](https://guides.etalab.gouv.fr/qualite/documenter-les-donnees/) of data, [description of metadata](https://guides.etalab.gouv.fr/qualite/documenter-les-donnees/#description-des-metadonnees) and how [reuses are important](https://guides.etalab.gouv.fr/juridique/reutilisation/#qu-est-ce-qu-une-reutilisation) for example (see dimension 1 for more insight).

Reuses are highlighted in the same way as data [on the portal](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/reuses/covid-19-en-france-au-06-juillet-2020-surveillance-des-entrees-hospitalieres-et-des-tests-de-depistage/) and through our [communication](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/posts/).

**Machine readability and openness** :

A documentation is available to support producers on how to publish data sets in machine readable format: [here](https://guides.etalab.gouv.fr/data.gouv.fr/) and [here](https://doc.data.gouv.fr/a-propos/que-publier-et-comment-le-publier/).

On top of advocacy programs and [editorial content](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/posts/) we develop tools to help producers to provide high quality data. For instance,

- The Etalab team launched in 2019 [www.schema.data.gouv.fr](http://www.schema.data.gouv.fr/) a referencing, validation and support service for the creation of public data schemas for France. From schema.data.gouv.fr and the tools attached to it, it is possible to consult the referenced data schema, to validate that a data set conforms to a schema, to generate documentation and sample data sets automatically or suggest standardized entry forms. Any actor is also free to propose the referencing of diagrams on schema.data.gouv.fr.
- Etalab has also developed a tool, [CSV-GG](https://csv-gg.etalab.studio/), that helps you create a CSV file that conforms to an existing data schema. The tool guides you through several steps to obtain a complete, valid and structured file.

**Open identifier**

Discoverability of data.gouv.fr catalog is one of our top priorities. With this in mind a lot of effort are put in the  improvement of the search engine, for example:

- the tag system of the datasets makes it possible to optimize the search
- the ""highlight"" button for the platform administrator allows to bring up a data set in the ranking

**Linked-data**

We wrote a [quality guide](https://guides.etalab.gouv.fr/qualite/preparer-le-jeu-de-donnees/#la-structure-du-jeu-de-donnees) to help administration in the open data strategy. This guide underlines the necessity to include “linked data” (données pivot) that facilitates the crossover between datasets. Ex. Identification number of a company, geolocalisation etc.

We are also working on a tool enabling the enrichment of resources with additional third party data available on the portal

The platform data.gouv.fr allows users to link a specific resource to a common standard / schema shared by the community. This feature allow users to access easily to all the resources depending of this specific schema.";;;;;30

On top of that, each new datasets are monitored in our internal team and we can check for each one if correction needs to be done. For structured data related to a data model, we have a monitored tool that inspect the data itself and try to validate it within its declared data model. If validation fails, alert are sent to our team and we can contact producer so it can modify data to respect data model.
