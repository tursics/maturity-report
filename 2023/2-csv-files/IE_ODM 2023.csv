These regulations fully transposed the Directive in to Irish law.  They also include the request regime for accessing open datasets and the appeals process a requester can utilise if they are not provided with the data requested. SI 376/2021 is the basis for Irish Government policy on open data.
The regulations may be accessed at https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/376/made/en/html

An official government Circular which provides instructions and guidance for all public service organisations on implementing the Open Data Directive was issued in December 2021.  This Circular sets out the actions public bodies and public utilities need to carry out to meet their obligations under the Directive.  Circular 20/2021 – Open Data Directive https://www.gov.ie/en/circular/523a7-circular-202021-open-data-directive/  

Our Open Data policy is to encourage and drive the publication, uptake and use of Open Data and in doing so add value to the economy by increasing transparency, stimulating new business applications, building trust in Government and improving the lives of citizens by delivering better services.
This is being achieved by:
• Encouraging the release of all appropriate high value government data as Open Data by default 
• Building a value driven economy by making it publicly available and freely reusable 
• Engaging with a broad community of stakeholders to promote and encourage the use of Open Data";The answer option 'Other' should be selected by countries that do not have a specific open data policy in place but have a national policy (on data, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, eGovernment or similar) that explicitly includes open data in its text and scope.;;;;30

These priorities are included in the draft strategy currently being reviewed.  This strategy will be published as 'THE IRISH OPEN DATA STRATEGY 2023-2027' later in 2023.
Until then, the current open data strategy remains operational and is accessible at;  https://data.gov.ie/uploads/page_images/2018-03-07-114306.063816Final-Strategy-online-version1.pdf 
The national Open Data Strategy for 2017-2022 was published in July 2017. The vision is for Ireland to be a leader in Open Data and to create an environment where the economic, social and democratic benefits of Open Data are recognised and realised. Two core objectives of the Strategy are the publication of high value government data in open format, making it publicly available and freely reusable; and engaging with a broad community of stakeholders to promote its social and economic benefits. 
The Strategy sets out actions under seven strategic themes: 
- broaden the range of public bodies actively engaged in the Open Data initiative; 
- broaden the scope of the Initiative and improve the quality, quantity and range of datasets available on the Portal data.gov.ie; 
- continued engagement with stakeholders and encourage the use of Open Data; 
- support and encourage various groups of Open Data Users, 
- the provision of a framework to support and train public bodies in their Open Data activities; 
- evaluation of the impacts and benefits of the Initiative; and
- ensuring that effective governance structures are in place to implement the Strategy.
The necessary actions to achieve the objectives of the Strategy are set out in an Implementation Plan which specifies the responsible body for each action and a timeframe for delivery. 

Our Open Data Strategy is closely aligned with other key government priorities and associated policies including:
• Public Service Reform Programme
   Connecting Government 2030: A digital and ICT Strategy for Ireland's Public Service
• Public Service Data Strategy 2019-2023
• Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019
• National Data Infrastructure
- Freedon of Information 2014

*******The national Digital Strategy published in February 2022 ********

The Public Service Data Strategy 2019-2023 underpins the Open Data Strategy and states that high quality and well-governed data, accessible by third parties through an API-first, interoperable architecture, will further drive increases in the availability and value of open data in Ireland.

For Justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the main changes. ";yes;"Statutory Instrument (SI) 376/2021 transposed the Open Data Directive in to Irish law in July 2021.  This replaced the previous legislation which had underpinned the PSI Directive.  SI 376/2021 set out the request process which allows persons to request the release of data and the Appeals process if data is not subsequently released .  It designates the Office of the Inofrmation C ommissioner as the body who processes appeals under the ODD.  It also includes provisions for:
Requires PBs to publish list of their data 
Provide reports to the Minister
Publish information on their websites to provide information on charging.
Circular 20/2021 (of December 2021) puts in place a policy framework for PBs to comply with the ODD.  It sets out their obligations and requirements under the Directive and lists a set of actions to be completed to comply with the Directive.

The Training Framework and Technical Support Framework are currently available to all public bodies to support their compliance with the Open Data Directive.  Public sector staff can avail of open data auditing, management and publishing training.  There are also courses available in linked data and data anonymisation.  The Technical Support Framework allows public bodies to acquire specialised professional support for open data management, strategy development and data auditing.

The Government's Digital Strategy was published in February 2022 and contains a committment to open data and better use of data.

5;"Does the national strategy/policy include an action plan with measures to be implemented in the open data field?

For justification:
If yes, please briefly describe the main measures described by the action plan.";yes;" The 2017-2022 Strategy sets out seven strategic themes which guide the implementation of the Open Data initiative over the lifetime of the Strategy.  A list of actions under each theme specifies the timeline for implementation and the stakeholders responsible. These include: B35 broaden the range of public bodies actively engaged in the Open Data Initiative; 
• improve the quality, quantity and range of datasets available and improve the range of services available on the national Open Data portal; 
• continued engagement with stakeholders to encourage the use of Open Data; 
• support and encourage various groups of Open Data users including public service bodies; 
• evaluation of the impacts, benefits and risks of the Initiative; and 
• ensure that effective governance structures are in place to implement the Strategy.   

The necessary actions to achieve these objectives are set out in an Implementation Plan which specifies the responsible body for each action and expected timeframe for delivery.  The action plan is set out in pages 19 to 26 of the Open Data Strategy document.  https://data.gov.ie/uploads/page_images/2018-03-07-114306.063816Final-Strategy-online-version1.pdf

6a;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to real-time or dynamic data?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"Action 2.3 of the Open Data Strategy implementation plan ensures priority for release of those datasets that are recognised as ‘high-value’ (where use has been identified) as well as real-time data with options for access e.g. multiple format download, APIs etc.
Action 2.7 also asks public bodies to consider ways in which they can make specific commitments to long term support and maintenance of high-value datasets, such as agreements, good practice guides, etc. 
The Public Service Data Strategy 2019-2023 ensures that high quality and well-governed data, accessible by third parties through an API-first, interoperable architecture, will further drive increases in the availability and value of open data in Ireland.
Actions in Section 5 of the Public Service Data Strategy include:
• Develop a Government data catalogue, for internal and public use, cataloguing key data holdings within PSBs, supporting reuse and transparency 
• Develop a Government API portal, as part of the Interoperability Platform, supporting the discovery of data and services that are available for reuse via a machine to machine mechanism.

The technical services framework for Open Data and Data Management Technical Services Framework has been established.  This provides a cost effective, consistent procurement framework which allows public bodies to meet their obligations under the Open Data Directive and will facilitate greater access to dynamic and HVDs via APIs. The Framework will contains services under 3 categories:
1. Data Management 
• Data Audits, 
• Data Extraction, Transform and Load (ETL) and Preparation Services
• Develop a Publication Plan and Publish data 
• Data Maintenance
• Data Maturity Assessment
2. Fully Hosted and Managed Open Data Platform Solution
3. Development services for the APIs etc.
In addition to this, the Open Data Unit advises on and advocates for the establishement of harvestors to ensure access to data is as efficient and up to date as possible.
";Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time). ;;;;15
6b;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to geo-spatial data (e.g. in relation to high-value datasets as specified in the implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138)?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"Geospatial data is particularly useful for demonstrating the relevance of data.  Our strategy is to facilitate the efficient access to this data via spatial harvestors, for example via REST API , not just .csv and GeoJSON.
Action 2.3 of the implementation plan ensures priority for release of those datasets that are recognised as ‘high-value’ (where use has been identified) as well as real-time data with options for access e.g. multiple format download, APIs etc.
Action 2.7 also asks public bodies to consider ways in which they can make specific commitments to long term support and maintenance of high-value datasets, such as agreements, good practice guides, etc. 
Action 2.8 Use Eircodes in address data so as to facilitate linking datasets together when sharing & utilising other open datasets.

7;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to support the reuse of open data by the public sector?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"A central policy of the Open Data Unit is to support the development of open data as a core element in the public sector and to ensure there is a critical mass of public servants with adequate data skills to use and develop public sector data for the provision of government services, support of evidence-based decision-making and transparancy and trust in the government. Regular meetings, webinars and information dissemination are central to achieving this.
A key objective of the Open Data Strategy is to develop a data driven culture across the Public Service with a lifecycle approach taken to data management and publication of data in open format becoming a matter of routine.
Action 3.8 
Use Open Data to support analytics internally in order to improve evidence based decision-making (in developing and implementing public policy).
Action 5.2
Provide training for relevant staff in public bodies: general Open Data training, data management, technical and operational as appropriate (through draw down from training framework or by other means such as qualified Open Data ‘train the trainers’). Consider opportunities for the pooling of resources by public bodies in this regard.

The Open Data Governance Board (ODGB) was established in 2015 to provide strategic leadership and governance in line with best international practice in the area of Open Data.  Membership of the ODGB is drawn from a mix of backgrounds including academia, research, business, journalists, civil society, etc.  and is recruited transparently via https://www.stateboards.ie/en/

It is tasked with considering how to improve the capacity and capability of public bodies in implementing Open Data, and considering opportunities to maximise the value of public sector data and information for long-term economic, social and democratic benefits.  The Board is also overseeing implementation of the national Open Data Strategy 2017-2022 in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure & Reform. 

The composition of the Board is reconstituted on an annual basis to ensure that the right mix of skills and experience are on the Board.  Applications for Board membership are advertised publically https://data.gov.ie/blog/do-you-wish-to-become-a-member-of-the-open-data-governance-board-odgb and two new members were appointed in Feburary 2021. 

The ODGB is supported by a Secretariat located in the Government Reform Unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Technical advice and support is provided to the Board by the Open Data Advisory Group. 
The following governance structure is in place to support the Open Data Initiative:
• Open Data Governance Board (ODGB) leads and drives the Open Data Initiative, ensured the implementation of the Open Data Strategy 2017- 2022 and will ensure the implementation of the new 2023-2027 Strategy.

For justification:
*  Could you briefly describe why this model was chosen/works best for your country?";top-down;"Good governance has been key to the progress of Open Data in Ireland.  The policy for Open Data is set and coordinated at the national level by the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform (DPENDPDR) and is a key element of the government’s reform agenda.  DPENDPDR is responsible for the implementation of government reform across all levels of government, both central and regional.  The positioning of the governance structures for Open Data within DPENDPDR provides the structure and ability to drive the policy as national policy with central government departments, local government, government agencies and all public bodies.

Once the Open Data Strategy was adopted as Government policy in July 2017 this placed an obligation on all public sector organisations to implement the actions contained in the Implementation Plan.

Coordination of the implementation of the national Open Data Strategy is done in conjunction with the Open Data Advisory Group on Open Data and Liaison Officer (of which some 120 are in place across the Public Service).  While some public service organisations, particular the larger ones have their own Open Data policies, these are aligned with the national Strategy.  In addition where some of the larger public service organisation or local authorities have their own regional portals, these in the main are federated and link back to the national portal (which we have set out in a policy document).

;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

Access to data and the visibility of data in decision-making processes is a central tenet of government policy and was specifically referenced in the National Digital Strategy.  There are frequent references to the importance of the data in local government activities.  In the last 12 months, there have been a number of new open data hubs to highlight the availability of an organisation's open data-; https://opendata.agriculture.gov.ie/; https://www.valoff.ie/en/open-data/open-data-information/#:~:text=Tailte%20%C3%89ireann%20is%20committed%20to,open%2C%20free%20and%20reusable%20formats.  ; https://www.met.ie/about-us/specialised-services/open-data

At a national level, Ireland is preparing its next Open Data Strategy and the Open Data Unit has held a series of Town Hall style events, both in person and online to consult as broad a sample of stakeholders as possible and gather their input for this strategy.

An ongoing survey for Open Data is being carried out on Data.Gov.ie which provides information on data reuse and the priorities and needs of our reusers.

The Stats page on the portal provides an overview of data reuse nationally. https://data.gov.ie/stats";"With 'national level' we refer to either central government, federal government, or top ministries.
Examples of such activities could be regular information sessions and/or promotion of published data at conferences and other events. ";;;;15

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe these processes and provide the URLs to support the answer.";yes;"Yes, there are a number of national level processes to monitor the reuse of open data.   Tools are available on the National Open Data Portal to measure reuse, including number of views and downloads of datasets, and overall usage of the portal. Utlising Fathom Analytics and Tableau, these statistics are publicly available at https://data.gov.ie/stats and dataset metrics are available on the dataset listing page https://data.gov.ie/dataset

The Stats page on the portal provides all portal users an overview of data reuse nationally. https://data.gov.ie/stats
This monitors and presents the metrics on the degree to which data is accessed.  Part of the remit of the Open Data Unit is to maintain a strong network of contacts with both data creators, managers and users.  Meetings are organised with data users and their feedback is actively sought on the portal, inviting them to comment on existing data and suggest further data that might be useful to them.";;;;;20
31;"Are there any activities in place to encourage public bodies to monitor the reuse of their own published data (e.g. incentives or obligations in place for public bodies or civil servants of national government)?
 
For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe these activities/incentives and provide the URLs to support the answer. ";yes;" Yes, there are a number of tools in place to support and incentivise public bodies in measuring the reuse of their own and other public bodies’ open data. There is the KPI tool that has just been developed to allow data publishers to monitor their datasets- show when the data was uploaded, what was deleted and the currency of their data.  The KPI tool allows PBs to compare the quality of their data with other PBs and monitor their own progress over time.

In general, Open Data allows Public Service Bodies (PSBs) to deal more efficiently with FoI requests and Parliamentary Questions as the data requested is already in the public domain and answers can simply be made in the form of a url to the relevant dataset.
The National Open Data Portal provides information on the number of views for each dataset on the portal.  This is 'upfront' and can be easily viewed when you go into view a dataset. This visibility and transparency encourages PSBs to more closely their dataset numbers in relation to similar organisations and provides impetus within the organisation for continuous improvement.  The most visited datasets are ranked on the open data portal at https://data.gov.ie/stats and the most popular Covid datasets are featured on the front page of the portal.
    
There is evidence that the release of open data led to increased efficiencies in some public bodies.  For example since Failte Ireland (Irish tourism board) released their data via API, instead of running custom queries and excel exports for individual requests, they can now direct people to their Open Data API.  Fáilte Ireland would have had numerous queries from consultants, research agencies, other government organisations as well as developers of web applications.  This was time consuming and data wasn’t current once the query was run. The data is now dynamic and has lessened the burden on internal ICT resources to manage ad hoc queries on data.  https://data.gov.ie/organization/failte-ireland.  An example of use of the Failte Ireland API opendata can be found here https://data.gov.ie/showcase/failte-maps
In addition to these tools provided by the National Open Data Portal described above, public bodies are supported through network groups and training. 
The Open Data Liaison Officer Network is a network of representatives from all Irish public bodies, coordinated by the National Open Data Team. The Liaison Officer Network meets periodically to discuss the promotion and monitoring of Open Data within their organisations and with their stakeholders. The National Open Data Team also uses this Network to push out information to all Public Bodies, such as information about events, training, new features of the portal, and supports. Members of this Network are also the contact points for specific queries about the reuse of data published by their organisation, ensuring the responsiveness of requests and questions. 
Regular Open Data Training is also available to all public-sector bodies, which includes the importance of open data reuse and impact and how to measure reuse. ";Incentives could for example be training, financial incentives, or awards.;;;;20

Understanding the reuse of open data is critical to ensuring that the open data published is relevant, useful and in an accessible form. The most important means of establishing this is by gathering data directly from the people, academic institutes and businesses that actually use the data.  To this end, a research fellow commenced working with the Open Data Unit in December 2020.  They are completing a research project on the impact of open data in Ireland to be completed by December 2022.  A survey is being used as our primary method to better understand how open data is used in the country. The respondants to the survey will then be interviewed, if they are willing to participate to provide more in-depth, qualitative data on the use and impact of open data, particularly high value datasets, to their work.  This is the link to the initial survey;

A macro impact evaluation to examine the broad outcomes of the initiative from a social, political and economic perspective.  At a micro level, particular case-studies can be explored to get a clear understanding of the impact of Open Data in specific sectors and under a certain set of conditions.  The Most Significant Change technique could be used as a framework to capture and analyse particular stories.  

The Impact of Open Data is one of the seven themes in the National Open Data Strategy 2017-2022: Theme 6: Evaluate the impact, benefits and risks of the Open Data Initiative and benchmark against other jurisdictions. This outlines “the development of metrics that allow benefits capture, for example, what contribution Open Data makes to improve efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery. Carry out and publish an evaluation of the impact, benefits and risks of the Open Data Initiative. Consider evaluation frameworks in use in other jurisdictions which address benefits and return on investment”.

Consultation with stakeholders is taking place on the next National Open Data Strategy and it is envisaged that the impact of open data will be a key area, especially in relation to high value datasets.";;;;;20

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the key points of this methodology.";yes;" Defining metrics to measure data use or impact can be difficult, especially if what is being measured is  subjective, for example, data quality. However, there are a number of indicators that can be
automated and consistently reviewed to measure data access, such as dataset views and downloads
on a data catalogue. For example, data.gov.ie uses Fathom Analytics to record dataset page views and downloads. If a publisher publishes data via an API, the number of API requests can be measured to better understand usage. 

Impact stories and Showcases on the Portal provide examples of use and demonstrate the potential of open data, facilitating wider access to the data, and can encourage further use of the data. Examples can be provided by the publisher directly, or contributed by other users with the support of the publisher.  https://data.gov.ie/showcase/active-travel-counts

In order to evaluate the impact of Ireland’s Open Data Initiative, both a macro and mirco approach will be taken.  A macro impact evaluation will examine the broad outcomes of the initiative from a social, political and economic perspective.   At a micro level particular case-studies can be explored to get a clear understanding of the impact of Open Data in specific sectors and under a certain set of conditions.   The development of the case studies and the research itself may necessitate the researcher surveying businesses, open data users and other relevant parties.

On Friday the 24th of February, Smart Dublin, an organisation founded by the four Dublin Local Authorities, partnered up with Google and Aclima, to launch a weekend- long Hackathon focused on improving air quality. It was the largest Air Quality Data Hack Ireland has ever seen. Air quality is a serious challenge facing our cities and one that not only affects the environment, but society as a whole. Over the last 16 months, equipped with Aclima’s air sensing platform, Google we able to collect over 50 million records at 5 million locations of street level air quality data for Dublin.Over the 3 days of the Hackathon, more than 100 participants gathered in the Dublin Google Offices and spent the weekend hacking these 50 million measurements of air quality data collected as part of the ‘Google Air View Dublin’ project. The aim was for the participants, spread across 16 teams, to come up with ways to help tackle air pollution in Dublin, given the hyperlocal, rich open data collected. This open data is available to view on Google’s Environmental Insights Explorer and on Smart Dublin’s open data platform and by making this data accessible and open, we hope to see local government, businesses and the general public working collaboratively to improve air quality for Dublin.

The event was a great success, with teams coming up with innovative and imaginative solutions that could certainly help tackle air quality in Ireland. https://data.gov.ie/blog/smart-dublin-hackathon

A banner to facilitae easy acces to Covid data has been added to the home page.

In general, we work on improving the metadata to make discovering relevant data more easy. Examples of this work would be manually adding tags to harvested datasets- adding further discoverability to data than the publishers have added themselves.

We have 'Featured' datasets those that are kept at the top of the list because they are deemed to be important in some way. This makes discovering them much easier.   We create data collections manually. for example, the Covid banner on the front page. This effectively curates mini-collections by associating datasets together.   ";;;;;10

PBs who wish to release data will contact the ODU in the first instance.  They will be directed to the OD technical guidance documents on the portal which set out requirements for publishing to the portal including the CC By 4.0  licence, the metadata required and the accepted open formats.
The PB will be set up as a publisher on the national portal and supported by the ODU to publish their data.  
Where harvesting of data can be initiated or APIs implemented the PB will liaise with the technical support supplier to the ODU to put these services in place. 
Most public service bodies do publish their data, the few who don't may not have tha capacity to publish yet or have little data to release due to GDPR concerns.  We are actively working with them to address these issues.  
There is a network of Open Data Liaison Officers across public service organisations- the Open Data Unit is in regular contact with this network to support them and encourage them to publish their data in open format.

A new Open Data Training framework was put in place in early 2022.  The courses which this training framework provides includes a course on the Publication of open Data. So far this year in 2023 there have been multiple training days on Data Audits and Data Publication.

For justification:
* If yes, could you provide some examples of the actions taken in this regard.";yes, or all public sector data providers already publish data;"Training courses have been put in place under the new Open Data Training Framework for the public service.  There have been 2 rounds of these training days so far this year-2023. These include:
1. General Introduction to Open Data
2. Open Data & Re-Use of Public Service Information (PSI Directive)  – Implications for public bodies
3. Open Data Audits and Data Publication
4. Introduction to Data Analytics and Visualisations
5. Data Anonymisation Techniques
6. Introduction to Linked Data 

There are also a number of actions the ODU takes to assist PBs to publish data. 
We meet these public service bodies to promote open data training, auditing and the publication of their data.  When PBs want to start pulishing data we will meet with them to guide them through the publication process and on their request they will be set up as a publisher on the national portal.
The Data Autit Tool on the Portal provides a mechanism for organisations to identify and catalogue what datasets they hold.  The Tool enables PBs to list and describe all datasets that exist within their organisation, so that the datasets can be reviewed and those that are suitable for publication as Open Data can be selected and approved. These datasets can then be published directly on data.gov.ie.

PBs are directed to the guides and documentation available on the portal that explains the steps and requirements they should complete to publish their data, such as https://data.gov.ie/docs/Open-Data-Publication-Guidelines-2021.pdf and https://data.gov.ie/uploads/page_images/2018-08-08-164247.606489Add-a-Dataset-to-Portal-Guide---August-2018.pdf

Data publishers who have relatively small amounts of datasts to publish can publish directly to the portal using the ‘add a dataset’ function.
Where PBs have large volumes of data or datasets that are updated regularly and harvesting of data can be initiated or APIs implemented the PB will liaise with the technical support supplier to the ODU to put these services in place. 
We also hold information webinars and an annual conference to promote the publication and reuse of data.

It provides them with the information required to address the issues identified and to then take the necessary action to resolve the issue or improve the quality of their data.  
The QA Validator is an exception report, that is, it only lists datasets with issues or potential issues.  Datasets are checked for missing or incorrect metadata, resources that are not in the format stated, broken links, datasets not being updated according to the stated frequency.  
The KPI Reports provides a summary of the datasets published by public bodies across the categories of data.  It provides publishes with a several views of their data including a quarterly summary of page views of their data.  It also allow them to compare how the quality of their data rates in comparision with other publishers.

In section 4.3 `DCAT-AP Compliance`, the focus is on DCAT-AP exclusively. We are aware that many of the respondents may be compliant with other EU standards, such as INSPIRE. For the purpose of this assessment, only DCAT-AP and its country-specific profiles are relevant.

106;"Is there a pre-defined approach to ensure that metadata is kept up-to-date?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe your approach.";yes;The Irish open data portal curretly has 17 harvestersthat update the data and metadata  automatically overnight. This includes several harvesters that manage data from a number of different public bodies i.e. the ISDE, GeoHive and CSO harvesters manage data from a number of smaller organisations in addition to their own.  This ensures an extra layer of data checking and verification and that data updates are regularly made.    Smaller public bodies with fewer open datasets publish their data manually, but the upload process ensures that the metadata is required in the correct format for the process to be completed.  In addition to this, we have added a number of tools for open data owners to check and quality control their data. These are at https://data.gov.ie/kpi-report and https://data.gov.ie/qa-report and allow the data owners to have an accessible overview of their dataset.;Please note that a regular updating of metadata refers here to an updating that is in line with the characteristics of the dataset in question. Different datasets have different requirements of currency. For example, a gazetteer of city streets only changes when new buildings and roads are built, or street names are changed, whereas the data on current weather conditions may be updated in quasi-real time.;;;;20

108;"What is the average delay from the moment the metadata describing a dataset is updated at your source, and the moment the change is visible on the portal (whether the process is automated or not)?

For justification:
* What type of data does this mainly concern?";within one day;All data sources are harvested daily, so updates are available within 1 day of changes being made;;;;;40
109;Where applicable, to what degree does the published data cover the full period from when it was first published until today? (for example, complete time series whether available for download or through an API);the majority of datasets;N/A;This applies both to individual datasets that change in time and to archives of the same dataset, e.g. one every year, every month etc. Administrative geography is an example of data that changes regularly. When new houses are built, new postcodes may be created, and the areas referred by pre-existing postcodes may change. Making available previous versions of a postcode reference file enables the reuser to correctly interpret the meaning of a postcode vs the relevant time context.;;;;20
110;"Following the publication of the implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138 on high-value datasets, is your country progressing in ensuring interoperability of datasets, in particular high-value ones, alongside the datasets of another country?

For justification:
* If yes, please specify how and highlight challenges if any. 
* If you are an EFTA or a candidate country to the EU, please select 'not applicable'.";yes;Yes, however, in most cases, we are at the beginning of the process of advocating for increased use and visibility of HVDs.  In the case of INSPIRE datasets that are also HVDs, they already are highly interoperable, e.g. ;"* The implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138, adopted in December 2022 and published in January 2023 by the European Commission, lays down a list of specific high-value datasets and the arrangements for their publication and re-use. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023R0138
