1;yes;"Yes, there is a data strategy in Sweden since October 2021, and in chapter 4 about ""Styrning, reglering och uppföljning"" (in eng. governance, regulations, and follow-ups) the transposition of the open data directive into national law is specifically outlined as a strategically important area. 
LINK: https://www.regeringen.se/informationsmaterial/2021/10/data--en-underutnyttjad-resurs-for-sverige/

However, the actual investigation preseeding the national law was handled as a separate process, so the data strategy could be said to point to that work in a supportive manner, rather than investigation being a part of the data strategy.

2022 (vi kan ta bort detta tycker jag):
Since 1th of August 2022, there is a new law in Sweden that fullfills the requirements layed out in the open data directive.
The government is proposing a new law on making data from the the public sector available. The amendments to the law are proposed to enter into force on 1 August 2022  (https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2022/04/prop.-202122225/)  The Swedish Government outlined  a broader national digitalisation strategy already 2017 (https://www.regeringen.se/regeringens-politik/digitaliseringsstrategin/) how the digitization policy should contribute to competitiveness, full employment and economic, social and environmentally sustainable development. The strategy outlines the importance of public sector information and open data as a fuel for digital innovation and new services, improved efficiencies and for our democratic and transparent society in Sweden. The information produced or collected in the public sector is an asset that is common to state and municipal authorities and society in general. By refining, compiling and using information in other ways, different actors can create new commercial and non-profit services and thereby provide the conditions for society to take advantage of the value that the information can have when used for purposes other than the authorities' own activities. Operators who want to re-use public information should, as far as possible, access data. The Government believes that it should be as simple as possible for as many people as possible to assimilate the value of this information collection. Authorities should actively strive to enable efficient re-use of public information to facilitate the emergence of an information market.

To implement the  this strategy the Agency for Digital Government (DIGG) was established in September 2018 with the purpose to support digitalisation in public administration with infrastructure and shared digital services. DIGG are mandated to promote open and datadriven innovation, the re-use of public information. 

Efforts supporting the strategy
- DIGG is responsible for the national framework of Europeean Interoperability Framework (EIF) where ""open by default"" is one pillar, see q1. https://www.digg.se/utveckling-av-digital-forvaltning/svenskt-ramverk-for-digital-samverkan. 
- DIGG is responsible for the national open data portal and the open data strategy with guidelines and recommendations incl API strategy and access and quality of standardised basic data, methodological support and guidelines.";;;;30
2;yes;"Yes, the national data strategy is called (translated to english) ""Data - an underutilized resource for Sweden: A strategy for increased access to data for e.g. artificial intelligence and digital innovation.

Following the digitalization strategy from 2017  (https://www.regeringen.se/regeringens-politik/digitaliseringsstrategin/) there was a national data strategy published 2021 to increase the amount of data being published and used for innovation, AI-analyses etc. The aim of the data strategy is  strengthening welfare, competitiveness and a sustainable society. The strategy contains goals with timelines as: 1) All state administrative authorities that can streamline operations and simplify for companies and citizens with the help of shared data, AI and data-driven analysis must have started this work by 2025 at the latest. 2) Publicly funded research data must, where appropriate, be open and accessible by 2026 and 3)  Swedish companies should be leading players in the internal market for data in 2030.

4;yes;"Yes, there are also other open data policies, for example the following:

# The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency has a policy for ""smart environmental  information"" that includes strategies  for open data, see: https://www.naturvardsverket.se/om-miljoarbetet/smart-miljoinformation/strategi-for-miljodatahantering

# The Land Survey agency is responsible for a strategy about geografical data which includes strategies for open data: https://www.lantmateriet.se/sv/webb/nationell-geodatastrategi/

# The Sundsvall municipality has a digitalisation strategy that includes sections for open data and data as a strategic resource: https://utveckling.sundsvall.se/malbild-och-strategi/strategiska-omraden-for-att-lyckas-med-digitalisering

# The Region Västra Götaland has a regional development strategy, and in the focal area ""Digitalisation"" (page 18), the importance of access to digital information that can be used freely is highlighted: https://www.vgregion.se/regional-utveckling/regional-utvecklingsstrategi/regional-utvecklingsstrategi/";;;;10
5;yes;"Yes, the national datastrategy outlines six strategic areas, and in each strategic area there are a number of strategic efforts/action plan described. The national datastrategy has goals including the open data field for 2023-2025. These can be for example specific goverment assignments or other types of actions and described goals. In particular the following strategic sections are related to open data: ""Insatsområde 1: Ökad tillgång till data"" (in eng. Increased access to data), ""Insatsområde 2: Öppen och kontrollerad datadelning"" (in eng. Open and controlled data sharing), ""Insatsområde 3: Samverkan och kultur (in eng. Cooperation and culture), and ""Insatsområde 4: Styrning, reglering och uppföljning"" (in eng. Governance, regulations and follow-up).

There are also policy documents from the Agency for Digital Government for example: https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer/nationella-principer-for-att-tillgangliggora-information.";;;;25
6a;No;UPDATED ANSWER:The values of dynamic data  and real time data are described in the datastrategy and the strategy outlines that the Agency for digital government shall outline measures. But the Agency of digital government has not received a governmental mission to actually follow up on the strategy or to outline measures based on the strategy. ;;"By dynamic data, we mean data that changes over time (see ""Guide to Answering""). Please describe the measures to incentivise the publication of real-time/dynamic datasets";;0
6b;yes;"Yes, geodata is a part of ""Focus area 1: Increased access to data"" in the national data strategy which will be measured. A lot of Geodata is fee-based in Sweden today, but it could change if they are regarded as High value datasets according to the implementation act for the Open data directive.";;;;15
6c;no;;;;;0
6d;yes;Yes, the national datastrategy states that metadata about datasets are to be shared through Sveriges dataportal which is shown on data.europa.eu.;;;;10
7;yes;"This is the goal of both the national strategy and the new datalaw implementing the Open data directive in Sweden. For example by increasing the amount of data. This will be measured in an annual  follow-up.There are also principles and guidelines from the Agency for Digital Government which include recommendations for increased interoperability etc which could be used for the follow-up, see:

# https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer/nationella-principer-for-att-tillgangliggora-information 
# https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer/vagledning-for-att-tillgangliggora-information ";;;;15
8;yes;"For example in the the goal for ""Increased access to data"" in the National data strategy:
Goal: Access to data shared openly or controlled to increase continuously.
In 2023, there must be shared data to meet prioritized societal challenges
as well as within a majority of data areas defined in the EU's data strategy.
The following areas are prioritized: priority societal challenges, European
common data areas, areas with identified valuable data sets
as well as areas where data is requested by e.g. business.";;;;15
9a;yes;Yes, but indirectly since the data strategy points out the new open data law as an important step for achieving increased data sharing and data use, and the requirements related to maintaining a data inventory is regulated in that law. The Agency for digital government (digg.se) is responsible for holding the national open data inventory via the national dataportal (dataportal.se).;;;;15
9b;yes;The Swedish data portal (the national data inventory) is for both open data and for shared data.;;;;10

10b;yes, regular consultations;;;;;10
10c;yes;"The organisation in Sweden is decentralised and there is no national coordination for the implementation of the high-value datasets regulation, but The Agency for Digital Government (digg.se) have had webinars to inform the different organisations about the imlementation act and publishing legal support https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer/information-om-oppna-datalagen/vardefulla-datamangder.

11b;yes;In 2022 the Agency for Digital Government proposed to the Swedish government that Sweden should join the IODC, and a government decision on this matter was made in mars 2023. Sweden is in the process of joining the IODC. https://www.regeringen.se/pressmeddelanden/2023/03/sverige-ansluter-sig-till-international-open-data-charter-data-fran-offentliga-forvaltningen-gors-mer-oppen-och-lattillganglig/;;;;N/A
D1.2;;;;;;160
12;yes;The Agency for Digital Government (digg.se) is responsible for the open data portal and the national guidelines. All data owners are responsible for their open data quality and compliance, as well as how they include the users and other stakeholders in the publishing and re-using process. This relates also to the government responsiblity for government registers. ;;;;30
13;hybrid;"The Swedish model is decentralised with government agencies, regional authorities and local municipalites. The federal government cannot give special assignments to municipalites so the model has taken into account for this, to rather use external government funding and incentives for the local/regional level.

#The ministry assigns centrally funded projects and initiatives to speed up progress in selected areas/domains/sectors. 
#Innovation agency funds and incentivives local and regional, and domain specific labs through government funding. 
#However, since our open by default policy and there are many initiatives that are developed and pursued at local level with no central guidance, or as a part of business development. 

We encourage local and sector-specific projects, however it is a challenge to coordinate all and drive them to publish the data so that it is visible through the national open data portal. To further incentivavives open data and data for innovation and AI development, Innovation agency Vinnova funds projects. Vinnova, The National Innovation Agency are financing and incentivising initiatives for open and datadriven innvotion incl establishment of open data labs, cubs and factories in each sector. Vinnova also promotes and finance civic-tech iniitatives for open data re-use and open innovation with open data. ";;;;N/A
14;yes, all initiatives;"Yes, since the Agency for digital government (Digg) is responible for the national policies and guidelines for opening up data and other related recommendations (e.g. related to API development), as well as for the national data portal (including services for harvesting data to the dataportal), local, regional and national open data initiatives can use this support structure for their work. 
In 2023, Digg will also launch a shared metadata catalogue to further increase the support to public organisations, in particular those with less resources for developing or holding a data catalogue on their own. This is part of Diggs supports related to requirements in the new open data law (from 2022) that states that public organisations are required to share metadata about data that is made open at the national dataportal.  

Furthermore, Vinnova, The National Innovation Agency are financing many initiatives for open and datadriven innvotion incl establishment of open data lebs and factories. But naturally there are a lot of open data initiative that are locally funded also.";;;;20

17b;yes;Yes, the two teams (Government offices of Sweden and Agency for digital government) are working together both regarding more strategic questions e.g. having a dialogue about future government assignments or handling questions related to making prioritisations during on-going government assignments. Also, the two teams are co-hosting seminars, e.g. with civil society organisations. Moreover, the government team have been participating in the creation of digital educations that Digg (Agency for digital development) is responsible for, e.g. by recording videos about the national datastrategy and high-value datasets. ;;;;20
18;yes;"There are no requirements outlined at a national level for the appointment of e.g. open data officers, but the National Agency for digital government (Digg) recommends the appointment of a person per organisation that is responible for the coordination and organisational specific strategies related to open data. See https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer/vagledning-for-att-tillgangliggora-information#h-Organiseraarbetetmedtillgangliggorande

Information and data stewards for data are mandatory according to legislation but this is primarly from a GDPR perspective. See https://www.imy.se/verksamhet/dataskydd/ ";;;;20
19;yes;"Yes there is, although the ways in which is done varies depending on what government assignments are running or which networks or projects exists. At regular basis, knowledge exchange is carried out at public seminars such as ""Digg Forum"" (https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/evenemang/digg-forum), the seminars provided by NOSAD (https://nosad.se/workshops), and by discussions at the open community connected to the national dataportal (https://community.dataportal.se/).

At the moment there is active and regular exchange of knowledge between the open data team at Digg and ""open data officers"" in e.g. the following projects/government assignments: 

# A government assignment that relates to ""SKILLS"" actors and aims to increase the amount of open data from this sector.
See https://www.regeringen.se/regeringsuppdrag/2021/06/uppdrag-att-utveckla-en-sammanhallen-datainfrastruktur-for-kompetensforsorjning-och-livslangt-larande/

# The project ""National dataverkstad"" which is a stately funded project aiming to support regions and municipalities in open data sharing and use. This project is often used for proof-of-concepts related to Diggs development of recommendations, educations and other types of support, but also for identifying specific needs at local level. See https://www.vgregion.se/ov/dataverkstad/.

# The project ""Smart city lab"" which is a statly funded project driven by the research institute RISE, and which aims to support municipalities in progressing IoT use, including data sharing. This has led to the co-creation of support related to MIMs. See https://www.ri.se/sv/vad-vi-gor/projekt/smart-city-lab-kommunernas-stodfunktion-for-datadriven-utveckling";;;;20

21;yes;"Yes, but depending on the open data maturity of the organisation, these publication plans can differ in extent and level of detail. Our assessment is that the municipalities (290 in Sweden), since many of them are rather small and lack resources, are those with the biggest challenges to come up with a data publication plan. We know that many organisation do have some sort of plan, however, not available online. 

The project ""Nationell dataverkstad"" (in eng. National data workshop) helps Regions and municipalities with the on-boarding process, which includes coming up with a plan for publishing data as open data. At the moment, 10 regions (including many of their municipalities) have joined the project. In Sweden we have 21 regions, so the aim of the project is to get the 11 other regions to joins during 2023.

22a;Yes;"UPDATED ANSWER:
This part is still valid:
""There is a structured way of monitoring the digitalisation strategy, see https://www.digg.se/analys-och-uppfoljning/publikationer/publikationer/2022-09-22-uppfoljning-av-statliga-myndigheters-digitalisering-2021 Regarding the data strategy from 2021, the Agency for digital governement is monitoring this  in connection with  supporting public organisations in their work of implementing the strategiy and in connection with the work with for example national base-data https://www.digg.se/ledning-och-samordning/ena---sveriges-digitala-infrastruktur/nationella-grunddata.""                    

The onfollowing part (se below) is, sorry to say, not relevant since Digg never recieved an assignment from the government office to deliver the action plan mentioned in the national data strategy,: ""With the new action plan 2023 this will be taken further into a structured plan and there will also be indicators for these areas which may be included in the digitalisation report.""";"Last year an answer discussing the structured way of monitoring the digitalisation strategy was provided. Is this still relevant? ANd does it relate to open data?

""There is a structured way of monitoring the digitalisation strategy, see https://www.digg.se/analys-och-uppfoljning/publikationer/publikationer/2022-09-22-uppfoljning-av-statliga-myndigheters-digitalisering-2021 Regarding the data strategy from 2021, the Agency for digital governement is monitoring this  in connection with  supporting public organisations in their work of implementing the strategiy and in connection with the work with for example national base-data https://www.digg.se/ledning-och-samordning/ena---sveriges-digitala-infrastruktur/nationella-grunddata.

This might be explained by the fact that Digg received a government mission in June 2021, an couple of months before the national data strategy was released (in October 2021). So even if the national data strategy did point to Digg for the action plan related to the national data strategy, that assignment was not part of Diggs mission in June 2021.

3. The Agency for Digital Government is working with a data ambassador program to raise awareness about data sharing.";;;;10
25a;yes;"Yes,  the the Agency for Digital Government (Digg) are working in a number of to support data providers in their data publications process, such as: 

# Digg has a package of principles and recommendations related to open data sharing. See https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer. This support package was extended in Nov 2022 with new guidelines related to the procurement of data in order to improve the long-term possibilities for data to e.g. be relased as open data and in machine readible formats. See https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer/rekommendationer-for-upphandling-av-data. In april 2023 additional support to these guidelines in the form of text examples of requirements to use in the procurement process was released.

# Digg funds the regional project Nationell Dataverkstad (described in Q 24b) and has personel working in the project. 

# During 2022, Digg has been engaged in a lot of activities related to the National data strategy and a government assignment related to open data sharing. https://www.regeringen.se/regeringsuppdrag/2021/06/uppdrag-att-framja-delning-och-nyttiggorande-av-data/ .

# Digg has launch a new education called ""Dataambassadörsprogrammet"", which is targeted to employees within public sector and aims to raise the general knowledge level about open data, how data can be shared, and what the benefits are. See https://www.digg.se/om-oss/nyheter/nyheter/2023-02-21-digg-lanserar-dataambassadorsprogram-for-att-stodja-arbetet-med-oppna-data 

# Digg is currently developing a new tool called (in eng.) ""Shared metadata catalogue"" that aims to support public actor that don't have their own metadata catalogue in place. This can lower the threshold for getting started with sharing data. This will be lauched during 2023.";;;;15
25b;yes;"The Agency for Digital Government (Digg) has a recommended REST API profile as well as an API Playbook with additional support and recommendations. See https://dev.dataportal.se/ 
Also, at the national dataportal, integrated tooling for exploring API:s (Swagger) has been implemented, see an example here (the ""Utforska API"" button): https://www.dataportal.se/sv/datasets/180_7079/taxonomi-api#ref=?p=1&q=taxonomi&s=2&t=20&f=&rt=dataset%24esterms_IndependentDataService%24esterms_ServedByDataService&c=false

Digg has also more recently started a work with producing information and recommendations on how to work with MIMS (Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms) in dialogue with the organisation IoT Sverige and a project called Smart City Labs within the RISE research institute.

29;Yes, there is a strong focus;"Yes, the majority of public bodies that start publish their data and are in contact with Digg (Agency for digital government) in that process want to know how the data is being used. Among the more immature actors (related to providing open data), the pre-knowledge of the different ways that data can be used, including the benefits for public bodies themselves to use data, can still be considered rather low even if the interest of re-use effects are increasing. These actor search for general information about re-use. Among more mature organisations, the interest for the level of re-use is more focused on the kind of re-use and effects of data in various application areas, such as AI and sustainable development. 
Here are some observations: 
-	In most open seminars related open data it is common to get questions related to understanding the nature and levels of re-use of data. Particularity for data providers, the issue of ""what´s in it for us?"" is still very common.
-	Last years government assignment to DIGG was partly focused on supporting the understanding and ability among public actors to create results and benefits by using open data. This was based on identified needs related to re-use.
-	The Agency for digital government has started to explore possible solutions to measure the levels of re-use of data at various public organisations. 
-	When discussing the emergence of more detailed specifications of high value datasets (from EU), the question of expected levels of re-use of these datasets are vivid.";;;;15
30;yes;"The monitoring of the re-use levels is performed in number of different ways:

# Qualitative but unstructured information about re-use is collected at networking events, seminars, meetings and from various social media platforms. 
# In the community related to the Swedish data portal, there is also a special category for sharing examples of re-use. SOURCE: https://community.dataportal.se/topic/325/om-denna-kategori   
# At the national data portal, we also monitor the download statistics at regular basis. Most data providers have some sort of monitoring of at least download statistics, although the method can differ.

In the autumn of 2022 Digg lead a studentproject for 10 weeks that aimed at investigating what technical and organisational options and scenarios are available for developing methods for automatic measurement of open data re-use in terms of gaining access to e.g.download data and data on number of API calls from dataproviders. The goals was also that this could enable the developement of a dashboard functionality on re-use. We are aware that API calls and download statistics is not a full clarification of re-use, but rather a component for understanding re-use that needs to be further contualized with more qualitative stories on re-use.";;;;20

We are evaluating DCAT for high-value datasets to be able to distinct those from other datasets in the Swedish dataportal, more specifically in the search function at the Swedish dataportal. There was no assignment to Digg for an actionplan related to HVD (as already mentioned in  22a).

Moreover, as assigned with responsibility to foster the open data movement in Sweden, in 2020 the Agency for digital government (DIGG) described open data impacts as the following areas:
1) overall economic benefits (e.g. referring to the HVD-analys from 2020)
2) new innovative services and products
3) a data driven knowledge society
4) A more efficient and innovative public administration
5) the growth of data journalism
6) research with new possibilities
7) a resource for AI. 

See information about DIGGs description on impacts in Swedish: https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data 

In addition to the highlighted areas of impact, potential data users were also categorized based on identified need of data and general characteristics: 1) information driven users, 2) development driven users, 3) organisation improvement driven users, and 4) analysis driven users.

34;yes;"Yes, although it is not a single methodology but rather the accumulation of several processes.

# At a national level, the Agency for digital government (DIGG) is both pushing the importance of a user driven opening up process and user dialogues, as well as the importance of collecting the insights about the impacts of re-use through seminars, national projects for escalating open and shared data, dialogues/networking with public organisations releasing open data, and having a presence in related social media groups. 

# DIGG is also hosting a project about basic data, which focuses on both data that can be fully open and data that can be shared only within public sector, which gives additional insights into these re-use impacts. 

# At local level, the processes for estimating the impact of re-use are set up by public bodies at their developer portals, open registries/databases etc. Most public bodies that have an API strategy measures the re-use as well as have web analytics on their websites.";;;;30

These public bodies are using the data to: 
1) increase the efficiency in decisions regarding a clear-cut notification referred to them by the SFA. If there is a nature reserve or sensitive area adjacent to the clear-cut notification, then the CB will write informing the SFA which will inform the forest owner not to encroach on this in any way.
2) efficient processes in making decisions regarding new nature reserves. For example, if there is an adjacent area which has been cleared, then much of the biodiversity value will have been lost and they will not waste time evaluating the new notification.
-inform the SEPA which will ask the CB for an annual update on the sensitive areas. Whilst SEPA will already know the nature reserves and the areas under surveillance, only the county knows if there are further areas which maybe under consideration. Hence the CB provides an updated map to SEPA showing any new such areas.

# The app “Biologg” has been described as a Pokemon Go for the nature since it lets the user log different observations in nature as part of a game. This enhances learning about animals and wild arts, e.g. the more insects or mushrooms you are able to log and identity, the more points you get. The game is based on a database from the Swedish Species Information Centre. The logged information about species in nature is also shared with scientists in order to better understand how to protect biodiversity and also fueled back as input to the ""Artdatabank"" (database on species).

Yes, in preparation for negotiations on the list with valuable datasets listed in the open data and psi directive the Swedish National geological survey agency calculated the value of certain datasets. Environmental data was part of two that were calculated. Geological data was valued at 800 million SEK/year and i almost entirely environmental data. Geospatial data was valued at 5 400 milion SEK/year and is in large part environmental data.  Part of this is already released as open data and some was estimates in impact on releasing this as open data, see attached word doc for detailed status on availability/openness of the data. 

The analysis showed, of the proposed data sets, property data, geodetic data, soil type data, species observations, red-listed animals and plants, satellite images as well as image and altitude data can contribute especially to the work with the UN's environmental and climate goals in Agenda 2030 with the 17 sustainability goals. Making the proposed amounts of data available contributes to both the national and the international work towards these goals. Nationally, the effects are seen, among other things, in the form of the promotion of biodiversity, environmental protection, streamlined work in forests and land and increased opportunities for individuals to use nature and its resources. Internationally, the effects are seen in the form of simplified collaborations and increased access to information when data from different countries can be combined to solve global challenges regarding environmental and climate impact. Thus, they constitute the proposed data sets an important piece of the puzzle in solving global climate and environmental problems

Above that we saw that we have relatively large group of visitors that only visit the dataportalen once (which we want to change). We think this has to do with a change of content management system för the dataportal (due to SchremsII) and also less resources to provide news and good examples during 2022 when we put the majority on our resources on developing the beta.dataportal.se version and other non-portal deliveries in a big governmnt assignment (such as new recommendations for e.g. procurement of data, an education, analysis related to IODC and EU dataspaces etc...).

91;Few public sector data providers;"In Sweden, a number of different aspects contribute to the relatively low degree of public sector data providers.

# Municipalites and county regions in particular are governed with a very high degree of self-governance, that is, the decentralized government structure makes is difficult (if not impossible) to strongly incentivise these actors to share data they do not have to release. The implementation of high-value datasets in the new data law makes it easier for us (at Digg, the Authority for digital government) to work towards increased data sharing.

# Many public actors report technical challenges related to their metadata catalogue, and therefore we will launch a service for a shared metadata catalogue at dataportal.se during 2023.  The analysis covering this challenge can be found here: https://www.digg.se/analys-och-uppfoljning/publikationer/publikationer/2022-03-09-tekniska-forutsattningar-for-oppna-data

# A generally low awareness among public actors about open data, and in particular on the benefits of open data and how they get started. To adress this we launced an basic education programme called ""Data ambassador"" in Feb 2023 which gives the basics in open data including the general benefits. We now have more than 100 registrered participants. During 2023, we are also developing a learning initiative (education like) specifically for leaders and managers in public organisations.

# Together with the Swedish public employment service (a public agency) we developed a tool called the ""DCAT-AP-processorn"" which enables data providers to automatically create metadata from an existing API. See https://www.dataportal.se/sv/nyheter/17/nytt-verktyg-for-att-automatiskt-skapa-metadata  

# We started to develop the dataportal into more of a digital arena for knowledge sharing and dialogue with more important support (e.g. an additional focus on open source and public AI). The updated dataportal will also have increased support for co-created content (e.g. re-use examples), that is, more actors can be given publication access e.g. other public actors, projects that work with data sharing or for example Smart cities or IoT. We are not there yet, but we are working on it, see https://beta.dataportal.se/ 

# We developed new recommendations for the procurement of data so that when data is aquired it will be easier to open up. See https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer/rekommendationer-for-upphandling-av-data

103;yes;"Yes, when a beta version of the national dataportal was launched in Nov 2022 (see https://beta.dataportal.se/), we conducted a user survey on the dataportals community. The response to the betaversion was generally positive, although they also high-lighted a number of further improvements related to content and functionality. Some of them was also somewhat negative towards the choice of ""dark mode"". At Digg, we have summarized the comments, and also made our own usage evaluation to identify ways to improve the betaversion. This has resulted in that we will launch another UX-oversight now in May 2023. Why it took some time is because we have been involved in a procurement process since Dec 2022 for the web consultants working on web developement on the dataportal. This process has resulted in a change of consultants, and we are now in the middle of the work with getting them started. By this change we have strengthened the UX-compentence, which we felt was important for the future development of the national dataportal.";;;;10
104a;yes;We are working in agile processes with continous improvement and with a roadmap updated bi-annually. At the moment the dataportal is also reviewed as part of a strategic overview of all Diggs websites, with the aim to strengthen the Digg-common design principles and legitimacy for the different digital services and web sites. ;;;;15

104c;yes;"The portal is reviewed and improved regularly. We have a web development team. We regularly go through, react to and prioritize efforts based on user feedback  from the community feedback section. Before each quarter we decide on the priorities, that is then split up in agile sprint planning. However if bugs and errors are reported, based on the severy, we adapt.
On top of user feedback we plan efforts together with the API and basic data team on improvements as well in collaboration with other public agencies.  
When we are working in different government assignments and projects, we specifically use this context and participants to create dialogues about the dataportal, and collects the users comments and suggestions for improvements. These government assignments and project come with irregular intervals.

123;yes;"UPDATED ANSWER:
Yes there is. Documentation for the Swedish DCAT-AP standard (DCAT-AP-SE) is available in the technical documentation for the national dataportal: https://docs.dataportal.se/dcat/ Here you can find the standard in both Swedish and in English.
DCAT-AP-SE contains clarifications, translations and explanations of DCAT-AP for Sweden. DCAT-AP-SE is a national adaption of DCAT-AP, which could be compared with DCAT-AP as a European adaption of DCAT (W3C). The reason to have a national adaption is to make it easier for Swedish data producers to use DCAT-AP-SE and to make a uniform description of data sets. The data producers are required to use DCAT-AP-SE to make metadata about their data available at the Swedish data portal. DCAT-AP-SE is developed in collaboration to suit the Swedish context of organisations and data domains and to simplify the collection, search and presentation of data at the Swedish data portal. The main differences from the standard EU version is a translation to Swedish, more detailed explanations and suggestions of how to use recommended and optional fields in the Swedish context.";Please provide a justification ;Thank you for the updated answers. If possible, we are also interested in a brief explanation about (1) the motivation for a national extension and (2) the main differences from the standard EU version.;;5

126;yes;"Yes, we use the 5-star open data model as a reference and example for having various dialogues on data quality, and how data producers can increase the data quality over time. Also, we use this model in our education ""Data ambassadors"" as a pedagic example on how they can start on a rather low level and then increase the the data quality and means for access to data (via e.g. an API). Some public actors get stressed over linked data, and then we can also use the 5-star open data model to show that linked data can be seen as a goal rather than as the starting point.";;;;15
