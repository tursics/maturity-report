R9;no;Since the number of datasets is more tha 1500000, it is almost impossible to find anything across the EU in the EDP UI. So, the question is how to improve the search for users. Moreover, since many states have national specifics, for example the Czech Republic has a differently structured conditions of use, some metadata information is impossible to insert into data.europa.eu in a comprehensible way. But we consider it natural, data.europa.eu is more general portal than national ones. So the question is -single point of access for whom? Probably not for everone. For Czechs it will still be more convenient to go to Czech National Open Data Portal for Czech open data. But for searching for data outside the Czech Republic it is better to use data.europa.eu;;;;N/A

1;yes;"Czech National Open Data Policy is defined by the Free Access to Information Act No. 106/1999 Coll. that enables public bodies to publish their data in open and machine readable formats. It introduces the term “open data” and underlines the role of National Open Data Portal as its main information platform for open data in the Czech Republic. It is obliged by the Free Access of Information Act that all public bodies that publish open data, have to catalog it into the National Open Data Portal. Moreover, Free Access to Information Act No. 106/1999 Coll. defines data which must be mandatorily published as open data. The previous government regulation No. 425/2016 Coll. with a list of datasets was replaced by the new obligation defined in section 5a of the Free Access to Information Act No. 106/1999 Coll. The Open Data Directive transposition was the part  the amendment of the Act No. 106/1999 Coll. came into force in September 2022.
The obligations related to the Public Data Fund, which should be provided by guaranteed open data, are defined in Act No. 111/2009 Coll., on Basic Registers. See https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1999-106.";;;;30
2;yes;"The National Open Data Strategy is defined by the national digitisation strategy Digital Czechia adopted in 2018 and the main document that sets out the basic framework for this strategy called Information Conception. Open Data Strategy is fragmented into several principles and main goals of the Conception since it is not seen as a self-sustaining policy, but one of the building blocks of the digitization process. OD Strategy is supported primarily by the Principles P4 called Openness and Transparency and P13 called Open Data by Default of the Conception and the main objective 1.5 Development of the National Open Data Catalog and 5.10 Public Data Fund that strengthen the position of the open data both practically by supporting its position in data sharing process and legislatively by introducing the Open Data by Default principle. The Public Data Fund should provide guaranteed open data that users can rely on. In the first phase, these should be the code lists.

3;yes;"The Free Access to Information Act No. 106/1999 Coll. and Act No. 111/2009 Coll. on Basic Registers were updated in July 2021 by Act No. 261/2021 Coll., which defined new obligations in open data publication and in fulfillment the base Register of Rights and Duties, i.e. to distinguish public and non-public data. Then, it was further amended in September 2023 in connection with the transposition of the Open Data Directive and the determination of new obligations associated with user-friendliness in the Open Data Portal and in April 2023 in connection with the transition of the open data agenda to the newly established Digital and Information Agency.
 The Information Conception including all its parts is regularly updated through changes in the National Architecture of eGovernment that is regularly approved at the meeting of the Working Group on ICT Architecture and Management under the Council of Government for Information Society. One of the main changes related to open data was the update of the National Architecture Plan in the section Czech Republic Public Administration Data Sharing (https://archi.gov.cz/en:nap:sdileni_udaju), Public Data Fund (https://archi.gov.cz/en:nap:verejny_datovy_fond) and Open data section (https://archi.gov.cz/en:nap:otevrena_data).";;;;10
4;yes;Yes, there are several regional or local Open Data Strategies, usually as a part of an overall development/smart/digitalisation strategy. For example: Action Plan 2050 for the City of Brno (https://brno2050.cz/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Strategie_BRNO_2050_AP-2020_pracovn%C3%AD-verze_31-10-2018_web.pdf ), Smart Prague 2030 Strategy (https://smartprague.eu/files/koncepce_smartprague.pdf), Smart City Strategy of the City Uherský Brod (https://www.ub.cz/Public/docs/KOMPAS/Strategie_Smart_City.pdf ), or Smart Bohemian Region Strategy 2019-2023 (https://www.kraj-jihocesky.cz/sites/default/files/inline-files/SRJK_finalni%20verze%20dokumentu_pro%20zverejneni.pdf).;;;;10

6d;yes;The National Open Data Portal created in accordance with Information Conception of the Czech Republic and legislatively enforced by the Act No. 106/1999 Coll., directly and automatically sends all metadata to the European Data Portal, aforementioned types of data included. For the process see: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PtaZCXN3VBlAgXdeE6y4-qjPP3aPGJHs3Re6wI84jFc/edit#slide=id.ge280a34ec0_0_6 (slide 20). Regarding the geospatial and dynamic data, open data providers are, in accordance with the metadata standards, obliged to describe the format of data and key words to ensure their discoverability at the Portal. Citizen-generated data are not part of the Czech National Open Data Portal, therefore are not automatically sent to the European Data Portal.;;;;10
7;yes;The Information Conception of the Czech Republic fosters the existence of the Public Data Fund. The Public Data Fund should provide guaranteed open data (in the first phase the code lists). To support the re-use of data in the Public Data Fund, a notification hub will be created, which will send notifications of data changes. Due to new obligations related to fulfillment the base Register of Rights and Duties, the data users will have an overview which public data are collected following the agendas and gain the link to the dataset in the National Open Data Catalog. See Goal  5.10 of the Conception at https://archi.gov.cz/en:ikcr#sub-objective_510develop_open_data_and_public_data_and_public_services or https://archi.gov.cz/en:nap:verejny_datovy_fond.;;;;15

Moreover, the amendment to the Act No. 106/1999 introduces the so-called standard conditions of use, which must be respected by obliged entities when providing information (in open data format included). These are defined in § 4a as conditions that are ""objective, reasonable, non-discriminatory, non-exclusive and do not limit the method or purpose of subsequent use of the information provided"". Therefore, obliged entities cannot limit further use of data and information to non-commercial use only and should support the reuse by the private sector in any possible way.";;;;15
9a;yes;In the Czech Republic there is an inventory called The Register of Rights and Duties - a register that provides a basic overview of the agendas carried out by public authorities and the related data. According to the Act No. 111/2009 Coll., public authorities are obliged to identify what data in agenda is classified and to distinguish public and non-public data. A new methodology for defining data in the agenda has been developed in 2022/2023, according to which organisations should proceed. The objective 3.04 of the Information Conception is aimed at improving, updating and validating the content of the Register.;;;;15
9b;yes;"According to the Act No. 111/2009 Coll., public authorities are obliged to identify what data in agenda is classified, it means public as well as non-public data. Only public data are supposed to be open by default and published in the National Open Data Portal (Catalog). 
In addition, the Data Management Act (transposition of Chapter 2 of the DGA) is currently being drafted and includes an obligation to establish an inventory list of all available public sector data sources. It is assumed that this list will be directly linked to the inventory called the Register of Rights and Duties (see 9a).";;;;10
10a;yes;N/A;"Kindy fill in the column ""Publications of HCD in machine-readable formats via APIs"" in the table below. This column was hidden in the original questionnaire. Sorry.";;;20
10b;yes, other measures;"In autumn 2021 the National Open Data Team distributed a questionnaire to 300 open data users from different fields as part of the analysis needed for the new open data communication strategy. Some of the questions were specifically dedicated to their HVDs preferences. The materials the strategy is based on will be disponible online to the public once the strategy is finalized here: data.gov.cz/kodi.
In addition, an analysis focused on the identification of HVDs, their connection to national law, evaluation to what extent these are already published and who are the responsible entities was carried out. This analysis is publicly available and comments can be sent. See C1V6 at data.gov.cz/kodi.";;;;5
10c;yes;The responsible authorities have identified the datasets that must be published as HVDs and whether they are already available in the National Open Data Catalog. They are ready for their labeling as HVDs. To complete the process, we are waiting for the promised guidelines from the European Commission, which aim to adjust the metadata standards in accordance with the HVDs.;;;;15

12;yes;The National Open Data Coordinator is the main lead of Open Data Working Group which operates under the Council of Government for Information Society (government advisory and coordination body for reforms of digitisation of Czech public administration). The group consists of almost 30 Open Data Coordinators from ministries and other Czech public bodies. Open data providers held consultations with different types of stakeholders by themselves. According to the results from the questionnaire on the state and progress of open data that is every year sent out from the National Open Data Team to the open data providers, 41 (of a total of 56 that participated in the questionnaire) held regular consultations with different types of stakeholders. Moreover, private and civic sector are usually involved through specific consultations as for example HVDs (Škoda Auto Digilab, Geobusiness , ICT Operator or T-mobile ČR were consulted regarding HVDs issue on January 2020) or COVID-19 data (in March and May 2021 public authority UZIS organized 2 consultations for all the mentioned groups of relevant stakeholders).;;;;30
13;top-down;At the beginning of the process of data opening, a bottom-up approach worked in the Czech Republic - a few providers decided to open data in a good quality as a result of small local iniciatives. Subsequently, a public body (the National Open Data Team) was created within the hybrid governance model to assist these providers, but still without support of legislation. Currently, the data opening takes place within the top-down model, where the obligation to open data is anchored by the principle of open data by default, and all affected entities must participate in the process, cooperate with the National Open Data Team and publish open data in the National Open Data Catalog.;;;;N/A
14;yes, most initiatives;By most initiatives we mean all initiatives we know of (unfortunately there is currently no legislation forcing regional or local bodies to inform us about their open data initiatives and there is more than 6000 of them). The activities of the National Open Data Team (consultations, trainings, technical support, networking, e-learning, participation in the Working Group, data quality evaluation, promotion of activities to the public etc.) are open both to national ad local/regional initiatives. In 2022, for example, extensive support was provided to municipalities and regions, which had to comply with the new obligation to publish open data of official boards. For all activities see data.gov.cz. In addition the National Open Data Team regularly visits regional conferences and seminars to inform about obbligations and supporting activities.;;;;15
15;few public bodies;"There is currently more than 6000 of municipalities in the Czech Republic. Thinking of this number, there is only few public bodies participating on data opening process. However, with Act. 261/2021 Coll. the obligation publish open data of offcial boards for all municipalities with extended powers and regional municipalities (219 of data providers) came into force. When it comes to open data initiatives there are several of them on regional/local level. For example:
Brno - https://data.brno.cz/    
Hradec Králové Region - https://www.datakhk.cz/

29;Yes, there is a strong focus;Many public bodies participate in hackathons or organise them to support re-use and find out the use of their data. Some public bodies also monitor the results of various competitions, track the number of accesses and downloads of individual datasets on their websites. Some open data providers collect feedback directly from data users. The National Open Data Team regularly monitors these data providers´ activities and publish the information about them in the Annual Report about the State of Open Data that is published on the Portal (see https://data.gov.cz/výroční-zprávy/).

There is no mandatory part of the metadata record that would have to be updated when the data is updated. However, the quality of all metadata records can be monitored directly on the Open Data Portal, through which the Open Data Team informs the providers of discrepancies. The information on the status of the metadata is then further compiled in the Annual Open Data Status Report (see https://data.gov.cz/p%C5%99%C3%ADlohy/v%C3%BDro%C4%8Dn%C3%AD-zpr%C3%A1vy/V%C3%BDro%C4%8Dn%C3%AD%20zpr%C3%A1va%20o%20stavu%20otev%C5%99en%C3%BDch%20dat%20v%20%C4%8Cesk%C3%A9%20republice%20za%20rok%202022.pdf), which is reported directly to government, putting pressure on providers to ensure that the quality of the data and metadata is as high as possible and regularly updated. In addition, the most important providers are part of the Open Data Working Group under the Government's Information Society Council ""RVIS"". At all meetings of the group, which are led by the national Open Data Team, they are informed of the need to regularly update metadata and the data itself (meetings are held 4 times a year, see RVIS Annual Report where the emphasis on metadata is specifically mentioned https://www.vlada.cz/assets/ppov/rvis/vyrocni_zpravy/Zprava-o-cinnosti-RVIS-od-1--1--do-31--12--2022.pdf ).";;Please clarify/rephrase.
