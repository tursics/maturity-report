;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe your approach.";no;;Please note that a regular updating of metadata refers here to an updating that is in line with the characteristics of the dataset in question. Different datasets have different requirements of currency. For example, a gazetteer of city streets only changes when new buildings and roads are built, or street names are changed, whereas the data on current weather conditions may be updated in quasi-real time.;;;;0

108;"What is the average delay from the moment the metadata describing a dataset is updated at your source, and the moment the change is visible on the portal (whether the process is automated or not)?

For justification:
* What type of data does this mainly concern?";within one week;public registries before a cyber attack;;;;;15
109;Where applicable, to what degree does the published data cover the full period from when it was first published until today? (for example, complete time series whether available for download or through an API);approximately half of the datasets;N/A;This applies both to individual datasets that change in time and to archives of the same dataset, e.g. one every year, every month etc. Administrative geography is an example of data that changes regularly. When new houses are built, new postcodes may be created, and the areas referred by pre-existing postcodes may change. Making available previous versions of a postcode reference file enables the reuser to correctly interpret the meaning of a postcode vs the relevant time context.;;;;15
110;"Following the publication of the implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138 on high-value datasets, is your country progressing in ensuring interoperability of datasets, in particular high-value ones, alongside the datasets of another country?
