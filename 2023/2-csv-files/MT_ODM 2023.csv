;"Please note that this section differentiates between open data policy and open data strategy. Policy here refers to all principles/initiatives set out to achieve the goals established by the Open Data Directive, including specific national legislation put in place to transpose the EU law.

;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;65
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

In section 4.3 `DCAT-AP Compliance`, the focus is on DCAT-AP exclusively. We are aware that many of the respondents may be compliant with other EU standards, such as INSPIRE. For the purpose of this assessment, only DCAT-AP and its country-specific profiles are relevant.

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe your approach.";Yes;Data owners are encouraged through the Data Government Council to maintain their meta data published on the portal.;Please note that a regular updating of metadata refers here to an updating that is in line with the characteristics of the dataset in question. Different datasets have different requirements of currency. For example, a gazetteer of city streets only changes when new buildings and roads are built, or street names are changed, whereas the data on current weather conditions may be updated in quasi-real time.;;;;20

(for example, complete time series whether available for download or through an API);All datasets;N/A;This applies both to individual datasets that change in time and to archives of the same dataset, e.g. one every year, every month etc. Administrative geography is an example of data that changes regularly. When new houses are built, new postcodes may be created, and the areas referred by pre-existing postcodes may change. Making available previous versions of a postcode reference file enables the reuser to correctly interpret the meaning of a postcode vs the relevant time context.;;;;30

* If you are an EFTA or a candidate country to the EU, please select 'not applicable'.";Yes;The majority of HVDs are already made compliant for publishing e,g, as per Inspire, etc. Our major challenge is that some data included manual intervention to compile in a compliant fashion while the real time requirements in some Annexes means it needs to be automated.
