;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;600
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

We also carry out assessment in the private sector. During the last assessment, we involved roughly 2000 Estonian companies representing different areas and sizes for representative purposes, in addition to interviewing and meeting with representative bodies, universities and clusters.

For justification:
* If yes, please specify what kind of data proves this impact and provide the URLs to this data.";yes;"Main impact includes government being more efficient and transparent. Also, we see an increasing trend on data-driven decision/making on governmental level. We notice that enteties tend to have more willingness to develope technologies and find the ways of solving problems using data. 
The impact can be monitored mostly by the reuse. Open data reuse is very popular internally within the organization: many institutions have created interesting usage stories based on their open data, the most common of which are data visualizations. There are institutions that have found that they help non-thematic parties to better interpret very specific data and thus alleviate the institution's workload of clarifying the data logic.  Reuse cases can be found on our national portal in the use cases section https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/usage-stories. The number of use cases is constantly growing.  
Every year we carry out an impact assessment of open data and data managment in the public sector, results are published on our open data portal (on estonian language). Year 2022  - https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/instructions/avaandmete-mojuhinnang-avalikus-sektoris-2022

The yearly impact assessments are a systematic study, not anecdotal. Which are in addition assisted with additional studies and impact assessment requirements for public bodies. There are examples in all ministries and areas, where impact has been created and measured. For instance, Estonian Agricultural Registry is using satellite data (open data available through esthub) to verify whether the grasslands have been mowed to automate and support decision-making capacity, transportation authority is using open data to understand the likelihood of traffic accidents happening and plan investments to improve traffic management, Tallinn is using open data gathered through crowdsourcing to plan public investments in road maintenance and planning (https://gis.tallinn.ee/andmekorje/?fbclid=IwAR14eN87q_KGScM_E8jJVHHPdbOUdKnUKsss3rD-a24dFMZYMosQZ-JH_aU), and so forth. 

For instance, in the traffic accident likelihood project, we understood what are the key factors that contribute to the traffic accidents and how likely it is that traffic accidents take place, the F1 score was for specific classes (road which are less likely to have any major accidents and thus need intervention) was 0.98794618 and so forth. In the agriculture use-cases, the precision is roughly 85%, which means in most cases the public official doesn’t need to do on-site inspections, thus contributing to efficiency.";"The governmental impact is hereby defined as the beneficial effect of the use of open data on three specific challenges faced by the government/public administrations: 1) Being efficient and effective in delivering public services; 2) Being transparent and accountable in their actions; 3) Improving their capacity to make decisions and policies.";;It is not clear if this information is anecdotal or based on research in the impact study.

The Environment Agency and KEMIT have, together with a development partner, created a remote sensing information system for forests which enables records of forest resources to be kept in a geo-referenced manner, and forest information to be collected and shared in an operative manner. The created solution is semi-automatic, being partially based on machine learning algorithms, partially on the visual verification of remote sensing data, and partially on the software solutions of third parties. Remote sensing data are mainly used as primary data, but forest notifications, soil maps, and other such data (including teaching and validation data) also act as inputs. The processing will create Estonia-wide map layers about more important survey characteristics, such as a raster map about the height of woody flora (for calculation of the average height of the forest).

For justification:
* Please list the most common causes and select 'see answer box'.";see answer box;Few years ago we transitioned to the new portal and there is still some small amount of datasets, which we toghether with stakeholders still have been reviewing. So there is a chance that among these datasets can be the once, which are not DCAT-AP complient and we want to solve that.;;;;;15

126;"Do you use a model (such as the 5-Star Open Data or FAIR) to assess the quality of deployment of data in your country?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe.";yes;The national policy document Green Paper on Machine-Readable Public Data (https://www.riha.ee/api/v1/systems/eaatv/files/cdbfa8bd-2594-8ad3-6022-ff3d3dbf6781) stipulates that public sector data should be published as at least 3-star open data. Open Data online training which is intended for open data publishers also based on FAIR (https://digiriigiakadeemia.ee/) ;For more information, please visit: http://5stardata.info/en/ or https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/W3C04.pdf.;;;;15
127;"Do you conduct activities to promote and familiarise data providers with ways to ensure higher quality data (such as promoting the model referenced in the previous question)?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe.";yes;We created Open Data online training which is intended for open data publishers  (https://digiriigiakadeemia.ee/) ;;;;;30
128a;What percentage of datasets is made available under a standard open licence or an explicit custom open licence, in any data format including text documents? ;>90%;N/A;;;;;20
128b;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128a), what percentage of datasets is made available under a standard open licence or an explicit custom open licence, in a structured data format?;>90%;N/A;"Refers to open data that is available on the web under an open licence, in a structured format (=machine-readable format that is proprietary, such as .xls; .xlsx). Please note that formats such as .pdf; .jpeg; .png, .doc(x) are not considered machine-readable formats and should hence not be counted towards this answer.";;;;25
128c;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128b), which part is also in an open and machine-readable format?;>90%;N/A;Refers to open data that is published in an open (=non-proprietary) machine-readable format. A non-proprietary format is a format for which a user does not require a proprietary software package (such as Microsoft Office Excel) to explore. An example of an open format is the comma-separated values (CSV) format for tabular data.;;;;25
128d;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128c), what percentage of datasets also consistely use Uniform Resource Identifiers?;<10%;N/A;"Refers to open data whose comprising objects are accompanied by unique identifiers. An identifier may be the object’s name (e.g. city name ‘Luxembourg’, or ‘10717’ -- a Berlin postcode), or a word describing the object (‘population’; ‘gender’), or another arbitrary identifier such as ‘XYZ0’, an identifier that makes sense only in the context of that dataset. Choosing identifiers based on known standards should be the common practice though, to facilitate data integration and linked data.";;;;0

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe how.";yes;"The MoEAC together with Statistics Estonia and Estonian Information System Authority monitor datasets on the national portal and offer assitance in terms of dataset description. Moreover, all migrated to the new portal datasets have to be reviewed and become DCAT-AP complient.
