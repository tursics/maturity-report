The data.gov portal is the central catalog of open data in Portugal, with the function of aggregating, referencing, publishing and hosting open data from different bodies and sectors of Central, Regional and Local Public Administration, also functioning as an indexing portal, of content hosted on other open, sectoral or decentralized data portals or catalogs:
• The open data made available therein must maintain levels of updating and permanent quality, so that they can be reliably reused by other computer applications;
• If the entity producing the open data does not make them accessible from its own systems, it must make them available on the data.gov portal, and must also ensure that they are always updated there. The related metadata must always be made available in an updated form to the data.gov portal, in order to facilitate their search and location as open data, including in cases where the entity producing the open data makes them accessible from of own systems; etc.

The manual approach registry should be used for non dynamic data, but such is not controlled by us.

That box aims to help the user improve the quality of the (meta)data associated with that dataset. It gives an overview of what will be useful for contributors to find and reuse that data. Publishing a dataset involves filling in several fields. The system analyzes whether this filling was done correctly. From there comes information about the quality of the dataset - it can suggest a more accurate and detailed description, the use of more tags, or the attachment of resources in a more open and machine-readable format.
