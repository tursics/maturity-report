https://ogp.gov.al/en/faqe/misioni-strategjia - The OGP's vision in Albania is for the government to become more stable, transparent and accountable to their citizens, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of governance and the quality of the services the citizens receive. This will require a change in norms and culture to ensure sincere dialogue and cooperation between governments and civil society.

OGP aims to support the government and civil society reformers by raising the open government at the highest levels of political discourse, providing 'overlay' for difficult reforms and creating a supportive community of reformers of a similar mind from countries around the world .

Now that OGP has been established and has grown significantly, our main objective in the next two years is to make sure that real change takes place on the ground in most OGP countries and that this change is benefiting the citizens. There are three main ways for OGPs to help secure the right conditions for countries to provide ambitious open government reform:

1) Maintain high-level political leadership and OGP engagement among participating countries

2) Support internal reforms with technical expertise and inspiration

3) Encourage greater OGP engagement from a diverse group of citizens and civil society organizations

In addition, the OGP Independent Reporting Mechanism requires:

4) Ensure that countries are held accountable to make progress towards achieving their commitments to OGP

● inclusiveness;
● the right to information, consultation and regulatory impact assessment;
● open parliament.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 Anti-corruption. Awareness and education for anti-corruption mechanisms are two areas provided in the Cross-Cutting Strategy Anti-Corruption, 2015-2023 and its action plans. Specifically, measures are provided in the function of raising awareness and education of the general public on the consequences of corruption, promoting the public and increasing confidence in anti -corruption mechanisms, as well as increasing civil society involvement in these initiatives. The measures provided in the ISAC 2015-2020 and the Action Plan in force of 2020-2023 have influenced the creation of a climate of cooperation between the public and public institutions. Qualitative and efficient mechanisms for prevention and awareness of corruption have been created, there is good cooperation but more frequency is required.
The Ministry of Justice has a communication and visibility strategy, and an annual action plan with activities and initiatives with CSOs and interest groups. Annual, regular editions of the Week of Integrity since 2020, a close collaboration with business, the CSO and the Academy are good evidence but also to be replicated throughout the year. Continuing work by intensifying efforts to raise public awareness and education will create appropriate conditions for a society aware of the danger of corruption and with high confidence in public institutions, improving the public perception of corruption, not only by Local and regional and international organizations such as Transparency International.                                                                                                                                                                                                            Access to Justice: This component has found wide scope by being materialized and strongly related to the
implementation of the justice reform, the Crosscutting Justice Strategy (CSJS), the Crosscutting Strategy for Juvenile Justice (CSJJ), the Strategy for Public Legal Education(SPLE), and other measures taken by the Government in fulfillment of its mission
for an open, transparent and accountable governance/policy. With the initiation of the Justice Reform, a deep reform that is affecting in its entirety every element of the current justice system, a reformation of the legal aid system was also initiated, offering a new spirit, in sync with the requirements and legislation of the European Union and as a facilitating mechanism used to increase access to justice for groups who do not have the financial means to pay legal fees to the bodies/courts and at the same time to enable legal
counseling or protection. Free legal aid programs aim to bring the justice system closer to the needs of citizens. For this reason, this component is focused on providing effective but also accessible and affordable legal remedies for solving problems.                                          Fiscal Transparency: The public finance management reform continues to be a priority of the Albanian government not only as one of the preconditions for accession to the European Union under public administration reform (PAR), but also as part of the Open Government Partnership aims at supporting a more developed economy with better services to citizens.

Referring to the 2021 SIGMA monitoring report1, the overall trajectory for Albania in PFM is upwards, from 2.8 in 2017 to 3.3 in 2021, and is above the regional average of 3.1. Compared to the regional average, performance is similar or stronger in each indicator in the PFM domain, except for the functioning of internal audit (IA). Most pronounced is the strong performance in the domains of public procurement and the foundations for the functioning of Financial Management Control (FMC), IA and external audit.                                                                                                                                        PROMOTION OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND INNOVATION: E-Albania acts as a front-end point for government institutions to deliver their services, thusoperating as a one stop single access point to citizens on obtaining online government services,
as well as information on public services 24/7. By offering more than 1200 electronic services, the portal has improved the accessibility of information about public services, the level of public awareness about the procedures of public service delivery, and has most importantly acted as a robust catalyst in decreasing queues in public agencies’ receptions, reducing
corruption and bureaucracy, providing citizen equality, decreasing service obtainment time and promoting government transparency.
All of 1227 e-services offered on the portal are dedicated to a wide range of users, from unemployed citizens, drivers, property owners, pupils, the elderly, Albanians living abroad, businesses, civic employees etc. These services are also classified in categories (health,
economy, education, etc.) and are also searchable through the search bar.

 Milestone 1: Increasing the number of datasets accessible through the open data portal.Our main goal is to have a lot of different data available on our open data portal. We're finding and sharing all sorts of information about different things. This helps many people, like researchers, government workers, business owners, and regular people, find the information they need. We're teaming up with different parts of the government and organizations to make sure we're always getting new and useful data. By doing this, we want our portal to be the best place to find lots of different information.
Milestone 2: Raising awareness and promoting usage through multiple communication channels.At the same time, we know that having data available is important, but it's also important that people know about it and know how to use it. We're using many different ways to tell people about the data we have. We're using social media, online classes, workshops, and information campaigns to reach different groups of people. We want everyone to know what they can do with the data we share and how it can help them. We also want people to tell us what they think so we can make the data even better.
In short, we're taking these two steps to make sure more people can get data easily and use it to make informed decisions. We want to help create a world where everyone can understand and use important information.";Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available.

;"A Europe fit for the digital age
Embracing digital transformation by investing in businesses, research and innovation, reforming data protection, empowering people with the skills necessary for a new generation of technologies and designing rules to match.";N/A;"Albania's transformational progress has accelerated towards full digitalization of public services with the Government of Albania giving priority to expanding the provision of public services to increasingly facilitate online distribution where the Government of Albania is determined to return institutions to the service of fully focused on the citizens and has fully focused its attention on the transformation of physical counters into electronic ones. The national e-Government-portal, e-Albania, is the only point of contact which acts as a main platform for government institutions to provide their services and thus operates as a consequence the only point of access for citizens 24/7. The portal, which currently offers 1227 e-services, is connected to the Government Interoperability Platform which is the basic and essential architecture that allows the interaction between 58 electronic systems of public institutions. The e-Albania portal enables citizens to remember only one portal connection for finding public services on the Internet through an easily accessible interface that provides quality and fast electronic services for citizens and businesses.
Adding automatic data to the open data portal and access to Open Data Readiness as Open Data Readiness. This commitment will improve scale up the volume and quality of open data available on the Government’s open data portal. Several public bodies are actively engaged with the initiative, but more engagement is required to bring other public bodies on board to make their data available as open data. Greater promotion of the portal amongst potential users is also required. This commitment will make available new data from additional public institutions, as well as develop strategies to improve citizens understanding of the use and application of the Open Data Portal and increase accessibility to citizens. 
Identification of proactive life-events and implementation of at least 1 life event in e-Albania in the E-Albania government portal. Life events are events that have a significant impact in a citizen’s/stakeholder’s life and that warrant government awareness or involvement. A life event may be the birth of a child, change in employment status, a serious injury or illness, a home purchase, a crime, a natural disaster, or pursuit of a college education. this commitment will aim at designing new functionalities for improved service provision, user experience and interface. That includes re-organization by life events and pro-activity of services. The proactive electronic public services will respond to life events requiring minimal bureaucracy. Through proactive and life event-based services, this commitment will help public services to directly reach out to people instead of waiting for them to come to the government.";Example 1: The strategy explores how open data can be used to foster the digitalisation of public services.

Article 43
Open data
1. In order to create new information products and services, which are based on the information and data found on the opendata.gov.al portal, as well as for the promotion and development of the data economy, public authorities and AKSHI provide natural and legal persons the right to reuse information that is produced and maintained by public authorities as part of open data.
2. The authority responsible for the collection of fees, the amount of these fees and the method of payment are determined by the decision of the Council of Ministers. Payment must be transparent and non-discriminatory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         To facilitate data communication between institutions and software systems, as well as to improve the quality of statistical documentation provided to users, a series of metadata standards have been developed. These standards provide a structured framework for the organization and distribution of information on the content and structure of statistical data. To get the most out of web technology, most standards are defined in the XML language. Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) specifications are standards dedicated to documenting microdata. Dublin Core provides a standard for documenting linked resources.  The metadata standads that help to keep the portal up to date are: RDF (Resource Description Framework), DCMI (Dublin Core Metadata Standard), ISO 11179, SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata Iniciative), DDI (Data Documentation Iniciative), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), ebXML (Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language), ISO 19115, SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language),                                                                                                                                                                             ";Please note that a regular updating of metadata refers here to an updating that is in line with the characteristics of the dataset in question.
