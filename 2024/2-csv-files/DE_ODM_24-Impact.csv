;4.1. Strategic awareness;;;;;;;;
I1;"Do you have a definition of open data reuse in your country?
 
For Explanation:
* If yes, please specify it.";yes;"Although there is no single definition, § 12a (6) EGovG regulates the re-use of open data as follows:

""The retrieval of data pursuant to the first sentence of (1) [(= § 12a (1) contains the obligation for publishing open data by federal authorities)] shall be made possible free of charge and for the unrestricted re-use of the data by any person. Retrieval of data pursuant to the first sentence of (1) should be possible at any time, without mandatory registration and without justification.""

Furthermore the open data strategy defines as follows:
""When is open government data for the purposes of this [open data]strategy?
- Authorities have collected the data themselves or have them collected by third parties;
- freely accessible on public networks,
- machine-readable,
- non-personal
- freely usable,
- No safety-related information.""";Confirm;;;;;
I2;"Are there any processes in place to monitor the level of reuse of your country's open data?
 
For Explanation:
* If yes, please (1) briefly describe these processes and (2) provide the URLs to support the answer.";yes;"Yes, there are various methods for estimating the re-use of open data. They include the collection, tracking and publication of use cases and other monitoring mechanisms, such as:

- National level: Examples for data usage are collected via open government networking and made public as articles as well as on the CCOD website: https://www.bva.bund.de/DE/Services/Behoerden/Beratung/Beratungszentrum/OpenData/Use_Cases/use_cases_node.html
- The usage of CODE-DE is extensively measured and regularly evaluated.
- Regular INSPIRE-Monitoring by GDI-DE, Germany's geodata infrastructure.

I5;"Has your government specified what 'impact of open data' means (e.g. in a strategy document)?
 
For Explanation:
* If yes, how do you define the impact of open data in your country? 
* If possible, please provide a URL to a public document describing it.";yes;"Yes, but there is no one-size-fits-all definition of the impact of open data in Germany (which would, due to the constitutional division between federal level (Bund) and regional level (Länder) as mentioned above, hardly be applicable to Germany): most public bodies and institutions dealing with open data have delineated what the impact of open data (can) entail from their perspective.
- For instance, the overall impact of open data is described in the Data Stategy (see here https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1845634/f073096a398e59573c7526feaadd43c4/datenstrategie-der-bundesregierung-download-bpa-data.pdf?download=1.
- The Open data Strategy also contains a broad definition of the objectives and impacts of open data (page 5, 6), see URL: https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1940386/1d269a2ad1b6346fcf60663bdea9c9f8/2021-07-07-open-data-strategie-data.pdf?download=1
- Open data is a key aspect of the mFUND funding program. Innovation projects are supported financially that make their project results and research data available as open data at the latest after the project has ended. BMVI's open data portal mCLOUD (https://mcloud.de/) is the primary repository for the publication of open data for mFUND projects. The scope of the planned open data provision already plays a decisive role in the assessment of the submitted project proposals.
- A number of federal agencies have implented Open Data in all data relevant processes and in their strategic orientation (change management), e.g. BAW, BSH, DWD.
- The study  ""Kommunales Open Government. Gebrauchsanleitung für eine Utopie"" published by the  Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community moreover presents several concrete expectations of positive impact thanks to open government data (URL: https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/veroeffentlichungen/themen/moderne-verwaltung/leitfaden-modellkommune-open-govt.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1) 
-  In the course of the Ministry's project ""Modellkomune Open Government"", eight impact dimensions of openness and nine expected impacts for public bodies were identified (see pp. 61 & p. 65, URL:  https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/veroeffentlichungen/themen/moderne-verwaltung/projektbericht-modellkommune-open-government.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2)
- The study ""Digitales Gold"" from Berlin's ""Technologiestiftung"" outlines concrete impacts in different fields of open data application (URL: https://www.technologiestiftung-berlin.de/fileadmin/Redaktion/PDFs/Bibliothek/Studien/2014/140201_Studie_Digitales_Gold_Open_Data.pdf)  ";Complement;Yes;"Berlin: Yes, but there is no one-size-fits-all definition of the impact of open data in Germany (which would, due to the constitutional division between federal level and regional level hardly be applicable to Germany): most public bodies and institutions dealing with open data have delineated what the impact of open data (can) entail from their perspective.
- For instance, the overall impact of open data is described in the new Data Stategy of 2023 ""Progress through data use"", see here: https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Anlage/K/nationale-datenstrategie.pdf?__blob=publicationFile
- The Open data Strategy also contains a broad definition of the objectives and impacts of open data (page 5, 6), see URL: https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1940386/1d269a2ad1b6346fcf60663bdea9c9f8/2021-07-07-open-data-strategie-data.pdf?download=1";;;
I6;"Do you have a methodology in place to measure the impact of open data in your country?
 
For Explanation:
* If yes, please briefly describe the key points of this methodology.";yes;"As impact is defined in different ways (see Q33 above), there are different methodologies used on the national, regional, local and project-level. 
- On the national level, the implementation and corresponding impact of the open data law is measured through an online questionnaire and writing of a bi-annual ""Fortschrittsbericht"" (Progress report). See the first one and also the results of the mearung here: https://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/141/1914140.pdf
*(the second report is currently being prepared).
- The State (Land) NRW has developed a through evaluation for its overall open government strategy, which includes measuring its open-data-goals and the associated impact (URL: 
https://www-open-nrw.prod-drupal.nrw.de/system/files/media/document/file/opennrwt1web.pdf) 
- The project ""Modellkomune Open Government"" published an accompanying guidebook that specifies ""expectations"" associated with openness and concrete steps to achieve them. These are at the same time the basis for impact evaluation (URL: https://open-government-kommunen.de/goto.php?target=file_425_download&client_id=civitalis) 
- the Open Data Impact Award of the Stifterverband suggests that ""impact"" of open data in research means that the data has successfully been implemented in another societal field (creating an added value for society, openly available for a large number of users) (URL: https://www.stifterverband.org/innosci/open-data-impact-award)

Finally: in its coalition agreement from 2021, the Federal Government stipulated the establishment of an independent data institute in Germany. One task of this institution will be in future to develop further methods.";Complement;Yes;"Berlin: As impact is defined in different ways, there are different methodologies used on the national level:

I7;"Is there collaboration between government and civil society or academia to create open data impact in your country?

For Explanation:
* If yes, please provide an example
* If possible, URLs to such projects and collaborations.";yes;"Yes, see some examples below:
- the FU Berlin Open Acccess Initiative: https://www.fu-berlin.de/sites/open_access/akteure/oa-policy

- there is funding and other activities to promote research data management with the goal to make this high quality data accessible through the FAIR-principles for the benefit of science, business and civil society.

- In the mFUND program there are a number of projects that emerge from civil society engagement. One example is the project miki (""mobil im Kiez"", https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/miki.html), that aims to develop solutions for the navigation and orientation of people with reduced mobility under participation of civil society engagement. In total there are 15 mFUND-projects under participation of civil society organizations that use open data and/ or create open data.

- OParl is an initiative to promote the openness of parliamentary information systems at municipal level in Germany, see: https://oparl.org/

- There are currently 34 so called ""OK Labs"" all over germany which operate under the leadership of Code for Germany. These Labs work with open data on a daily basis and create several projects, applications and use cases. See an overview of the labs here:
https://www.codefor.de/; https://www.codefor.de/about/

The BMDV research program mFUND explicitly requests the reuse and/or provision of open data for innovative mobility projects. Here are three examples of funded projects within the mFUND program:
FixMyCity (https://www.fixmycity.de) provides a platform and tools for the planning of bicycle infrastructure. It is based on the mFUND project FixmyBerlin (https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/fixmyberlin.html?nn=12830). The tool is open to use under (https://fixmyberlin.de/planungen), helping to improve such infrastructure based on data provided by citizens.
RailBench (https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/rail-bench.html) is a currently running mFUND project that is developing a benchmark suite for rail transport automation and will be available under an open license. It's based on the KITTI benchmark suite, and data is provided by Deutsche Bahn and the German Centre for Rail Traffic Research (DZSF). Data can be found here: https://data.fid-move.de/dataset/osdar23.
Wheelmap (https://wheelmap.org/search) is a platform that shows data on accessibility in public spaces and public transport, as well as other locations such as hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, etc. It is based on a selection of projects funded within the mFUND program (https://sor.bz/FZ6U7).
