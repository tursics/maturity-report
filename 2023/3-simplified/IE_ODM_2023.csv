1;yes;"The Open Data Directive was transposed into Irish Law on July 22nd 2021 through Statutory Instrument 376/2021, the European Union (Open Data and Re-use of Public Sector Information) Regulations 2021.  These regulations fully transposed the Directive in to Irish law.  They also include the request regime for accessing open datasets and the appeals process a requester can utilise if they are not provided with the data requested. SI 376/2021 is the basis for Irish Government policy on open data.
The regulations may be accessed at https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/376/made/en/html

An official government Circular which provides instructions and guidance for all public service organisations on implementing the Open Data Directive was issued in December 2021.  This Circular sets out the actions public bodies and public utilities need to carry out to meet their obligations under the Directive.  Circular 20/2021 – Open Data Directive https://www.gov.ie/en/circular/523a7-circular-202021-open-data-directive/  

Our Open Data policy is to encourage and drive the publication, uptake and use of Open Data and in doing so add value to the economy by increasing transparency, stimulating new business applications, building trust in Government and improving the lives of citizens by delivering better services.
This is being achieved by:
• Encouraging the release of all appropriate high value government data as Open Data by default 
• Building a value driven economy by making it publicly available and freely reusable 
• Engaging with a broad community of stakeholders to promote and encourage the use of Open Data";;;;30
2;yes;"During 2022 a series of public consultations in the form of Townhall meetings and professional consultations with our open data network were held to guage the priorities to be included in the next open data strategy.  These priorities are included in the draft strategy currently being reviewed.  This strategy will be published as 'THE IRISH OPEN DATA STRATEGY 2023-2027' later in 2023.
Until then, the current open data strategy remains operational and is accessible at;  https://data.gov.ie/uploads/page_images/2018-03-07-114306.063816Final-Strategy-online-version1.pdf 
The national Open Data Strategy for 2017-2022 was published in July 2017. The vision is for Ireland to be a leader in Open Data and to create an environment where the economic, social and democratic benefits of Open Data are recognised and realised. Two core objectives of the Strategy are the publication of high value government data in open format, making it publicly available and freely reusable; and engaging with a broad community of stakeholders to promote its social and economic benefits. 
The Strategy sets out actions under seven strategic themes: 
- broaden the range of public bodies actively engaged in the Open Data initiative; 
- broaden the scope of the Initiative and improve the quality, quantity and range of datasets available on the Portal data.gov.ie; 
- continued engagement with stakeholders and encourage the use of Open Data; 
- support and encourage various groups of Open Data Users, 
- the provision of a framework to support and train public bodies in their Open Data activities; 
- evaluation of the impacts and benefits of the Initiative; and
- ensuring that effective governance structures are in place to implement the Strategy.
The necessary actions to achieve the objectives of the Strategy are set out in an Implementation Plan which specifies the responsible body for each action and a timeframe for delivery. 

Our Open Data Strategy is closely aligned with other key government priorities and associated policies including:
• Public Service Reform Programme
   Connecting Government 2030: A digital and ICT Strategy for Ireland's Public Service
• Public Service Data Strategy 2019-2023
• Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019
• National Data Infrastructure

3;yes;"Statutory Instrument (SI) 376/2021 transposed the Open Data Directive in to Irish law in July 2021.  This replaced the previous legislation which had underpinned the PSI Directive.  SI 376/2021 set out the request process which allows persons to request the release of data and the Appeals process if data is not subsequently released .  It designates the Office of the Inofrmation C ommissioner as the body who processes appeals under the ODD.  It also includes provisions for:
Requires PBs to publish list of their data 
Provide reports to the Minister
Publish information on their websites to provide information on charging.
Circular 20/2021 (of December 2021) puts in place a policy framework for PBs to comply with the ODD.  It sets out their obligations and requirements under the Directive and lists a set of actions to be completed to comply with the Directive.

The Training Framework and Technical Support Framework are currently available to all public bodies to support their compliance with the Open Data Directive.  Public sector staff can avail of open data auditing, management and publishing training.  There are also courses available in linked data and data anonymisation.  The Technical Support Framework allows public bodies to acquire specialised professional support for open data management, strategy development and data auditing.

The Public Service Data Strategy 2019-2023 ensures that high quality and well-governed data, accessible by third parties through an API-first, interoperable architecture, will further drive increases in the availability and value of open data in Ireland.
Actions in Section 5 of the Public Service Data Strategy include:
• Develop a Government data catalogue, for internal and public use, cataloguing key data holdings within PSBs, supporting reuse and transparency 
• Develop a Government API portal, as part of the Interoperability Platform, supporting the discovery of data and services that are available for reuse via a machine to machine mechanism.

The technical services framework for Open Data and Data Management Technical Services Framework has been established.  This provides a cost effective, consistent procurement framework which allows public bodies to meet their obligations under the Open Data Directive and will facilitate greater access to dynamic and HVDs via APIs. The Framework will contains services under 3 categories:
1. Data Management 
• Data Audits, 
• Data Extraction, Transform and Load (ETL) and Preparation Services
• Develop a Publication Plan and Publish data 
• Data Maintenance
• Data Maturity Assessment
2. Fully Hosted and Managed Open Data Platform Solution

Regular meetings, webinars and information dissemination are central to achieving this.
A key objective of the Open Data Strategy is to develop a data driven culture across the Public Service with a lifecycle approach taken to data management and publication of data in open format becoming a matter of routine.
Action 3.8 
Use Open Data to support analytics internally in order to improve evidence based decision-making (in developing and implementing public policy).
Action 5.2
Provide training for relevant staff in public bodies: general Open Data training, data management, technical and operational as appropriate (through draw down from training framework or by other means such as qualified Open Data ‘train the trainers’).

12;yes;"The Open Data Initiative is underpinned by strong governance structures.  The Open Data Governance Board (ODGB) was established in 2015 to provide strategic leadership and governance in line with best international practice in the area of Open Data.  Membership of the ODGB is drawn from a mix of backgrounds including academia, research, business, journalists, civil society, etc.  and is recruited transparently via https://www.stateboards.ie/en/

It is tasked with considering how to improve the capacity and capability of public bodies in implementing Open Data, and considering opportunities to maximise the value of public sector data and information for long-term economic, social and democratic benefits.  The Board is also overseeing implementation of the national Open Data Strategy 2017-2022 in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure & Reform. 

The composition of the Board is reconstituted on an annual basis to ensure that the right mix of skills and experience are on the Board.  Applications for Board membership are advertised publically https://data.gov.ie/blog/do-you-wish-to-become-a-member-of-the-open-data-governance-board-odgb and two new members were appointed in Feburary 2021.

13;top-down;"Good governance has been key to the progress of Open Data in Ireland.  The policy for Open Data is set and coordinated at the national level by the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform (DPENDPDR) and is a key element of the government’s reform agenda.  DPENDPDR is responsible for the implementation of government reform across all levels of government, both central and regional.  The positioning of the governance structures for Open Data within DPENDPDR provides the structure and ability to drive the policy as national policy with central government departments, local government, government agencies and all public bodies.

Once the Open Data Strategy was adopted as Government policy in July 2017 this placed an obligation on all public sector organisations to implement the actions contained in the Implementation Plan.

Coordination of the implementation of the national Open Data Strategy is done in conjunction with the Open Data Advisory Group on Open Data and Liaison Officer (of which some 120 are in place across the Public Service).  While some public service organisations, particular the larger ones have their own Open Data policies, these are aligned with the national Strategy.

The ODU has seen a significant increase in engagement with the Open Data Initiative since the introduction of SI 376/2021 which transposed the ODD.  This is particularly noticible in organisations who had not previously engaged in a meaningful way with the OD initiative in Ireland.  For example the Dept. of Agriculture has   put in place an open data portal (https://opendata.agriculture.gov.ie/) and is drawing up its open data strategy.  Smaller organisations who had not previously engaged or perhaps didn't think open data applied to them are now drawing down services through the Technical Services for Open Data and Data Management procurement framework.

2. A Technical Services framework for Open Data and Data Management was put in place in early 2022.  THis is again a collaboration with the Office of Public Procure to ensure easy access to the tecnhical services required by publlic bodies to meet their opligations under the ODD. This framework will provides PBs with access to a full suite of services to allow them to audit, catalogue, publish and host their data.
It provides efficiencies in terms of procurement effort, saves time and provide access to services through an easy to use drawdown mechanism. It includes:
Data Management services
Data Hosting
Software development services, such as the development of APIs

3. The Government's new Digital Strategy published in February 2022, states that' better use of data is critical to strengthening the relationship between governments and the people they serve. Strong data governance and harnessing public service held data effectively to provide better and safer access to data and transparency in its use is essential for improved public services.' 
Under 4.2 Data Use and Governance it commits to expanding the range of datasets published.";;;;10

This is a competitive fund designed to provide support towards promoting the use of open data.  The fund is open to all and has assisted the publication of citizen generated data.  The 2022/2023 Fund supported 4 projects such as 'Air Quality Data Hack"" by Smart Dublin in partnership with Google and Aclima. It was a 
2-day hackathon conducted to develop innovative and actionable insights and solutions of the Project Air View data combined with other open datasets.

Two other Hackathons held by University College Dublin were also supported by the engagement fund this year. DataLink Hackathon – a two week competition where 3rd level students across the country are given a problem statement and many datasets, they have two weeks to complete and submit their solutions.
Women in Tech Hackaton – a group of 40 girls, split into groups of 4 are given a problem statement and many datasets and are given 3 hours to make a 2 page PowerPoint.

The third project the engagement fund helped support was that of a Well being Analysis from Census Data
Using existing datasets from the CSO 2016 dataset to run a comparative analysis on key well-being metrics, based on geographical location. This was conducted by eTownz whos aim was to generate valuable insights into the factors that contribute to well-being and inform policy decisions that promote well-being at both a local and national level.                The final project was the Dublin City Tourism Open Data Challenge 2023
This challenge will help us understand tourism impacts, benchmark progress, and spur innovative new actions to help address any tourism and related challenge by using open data. The event/project aims to raise awareness and promote engagement with published tourism related datasets.";;;;10

29;Yes, there is a strong focus;"There is a large degree of recognition of the importance of data in Ireland and an understanding of the role of open data in encouraging citizen trust and participation in government, science and social initiatives and its potential to support data driven businesses.  Access to data and the visibility of data in decision-making processes is a central tenet of government policy and was specifically referenced in the National Digital Strategy.  There are frequent references to the importance of the data in local government activities.  In the last 12 months, there have been a number of new open data hubs to highlight the availability of an organisation's open data-; https://opendata.agriculture.gov.ie/; https://www.valoff.ie/en/open-data/open-data-information/#:~:text=Tailte%20%C3%89ireann%20is%20committed%20to,open%2C%20free%20and%20reusable%20formats.  ; https://www.met.ie/about-us/specialised-services/open-data

At a national level, Ireland is preparing its next Open Data Strategy and the Open Data Unit has held a series of Town Hall style events, both in person and online to consult as broad a sample of stakeholders as possible and gather their input for this strategy.

An ongoing survey for Open Data is being carried out on Data.Gov.ie which provides information on data reuse and the priorities and needs of our reusers.

The Stats page on the portal provides an overview of data reuse nationally. https://data.gov.ie/stats";;;;15
30;yes;"Yes, there are a number of national level processes to monitor the reuse of open data.   Tools are available on the National Open Data Portal to measure reuse, including number of views and downloads of datasets, and overall usage of the portal. Utlising Fathom Analytics and Tableau, these statistics are publicly available at https://data.gov.ie/stats and dataset metrics are available on the dataset listing page https://data.gov.ie/dataset

The Stats page on the portal provides all portal users an overview of data reuse nationally. https://data.gov.ie/stats
This monitors and presents the metrics on the degree to which data is accessed.  Part of the remit of the Open Data Unit is to maintain a strong network of contacts with both data creators, managers and users.  Meetings are organised with data users and their feedback is actively sought on the portal, inviting them to comment on existing data and suggest further data that might be useful to them.";;;;20
31;yes;" Yes, there are a number of tools in place to support and incentivise public bodies in measuring the reuse of their own and other public bodies’ open data. There is the KPI tool that has just been developed to allow data publishers to monitor their datasets- show when the data was uploaded, what was deleted and the currency of their data.  The KPI tool allows PBs to compare the quality of their data with other PBs and monitor their own progress over time.
https://data.gov.ie/kpi-report; https://data.gov.ie/qa-report

In general, Open Data allows Public Service Bodies (PSBs) to deal more efficiently with FoI requests and Parliamentary Questions as the data requested is already in the public domain and answers can simply be made in the form of a url to the relevant dataset.
The National Open Data Portal provides information on the number of views for each dataset on the portal.  This is 'upfront' and can be easily viewed when you go into view a dataset. This visibility and transparency encourages PSBs to more closely their dataset numbers in relation to similar organisations and provides impetus within the organisation for continuous improvement.  The most visited datasets are ranked on the open data portal at https://data.gov.ie/stats and the most popular Covid datasets are featured on the front page of the portal.
    
There is evidence that the release of open data led to increased efficiencies in some public bodies.  For example since Failte Ireland (Irish tourism board) released their data via API, instead of running custom queries and excel exports for individual requests, they can now direct people to their Open Data API.  Fáilte Ireland would have had numerous queries from consultants, research agencies, other government organisations as well as developers of web applications.  This was time consuming and data wasn’t current once the query was run. The data is now dynamic and has lessened the burden on internal ICT resources to manage ad hoc queries on data.  https://data.gov.ie/organization/failte-ireland.  An example of use of the Failte Ireland API opendata can be found here https://data.gov.ie/showcase/failte-maps
In addition to these tools provided by the National Open Data Portal described above, public bodies are supported through network groups and training. 
The Open Data Liaison Officer Network is a network of representatives from all Irish public bodies, coordinated by the National Open Data Team. The Liaison Officer Network meets periodically to discuss the promotion and monitoring of Open Data within their organisations and with their stakeholders. The National Open Data Team also uses this Network to push out information to all Public Bodies, such as information about events, training, new features of the portal, and supports. Members of this Network are also the contact points for specific queries about the reuse of data published by their organisation, ensuring the responsiveness of requests and questions. 
Regular Open Data Training is also available to all public-sector bodies, which includes the importance of open data reuse and impact and how to measure reuse. ";;;;20
32;yes;"Add info on MET HVDs here.
Understanding the reuse of open data is critical to ensuring that the open data published is relevant, useful and in an accessible form. The most important means of establishing this is by gathering data directly from the people, academic institutes and businesses that actually use the data.  To this end, a research fellow commenced working with the Open Data Unit in December 2020.  They are completing a research project on the impact of open data in Ireland to be completed by December 2022.  A survey is being used as our primary method to better understand how open data is used in the country. The respondants to the survey will then be interviewed, if they are willing to participate to provide more in-depth, qualitative data on the use and impact of open data, particularly high value datasets, to their work.  This is the link to the initial survey;

33;yes;"The definition of Open Data Impact is set out in the Open Data Evaluation Framework (Section 4.3) https://data.gov.ie/uploads/page_images/2019-04-24-104508.655717Open-Data-Evaluation-Framework.pdf, which recommends both a macro and micro approach. A macro impact evaluation to examine the broad outcomes of the initiative from a social, political and economic perspective.  At a micro level, particular case-studies can be explored to get a clear understanding of the impact of Open Data in specific sectors and under a certain set of conditions.  The Most Significant Change technique could be used as a framework to capture and analyse particular stories.  

The Impact of Open Data is one of the seven themes in the National Open Data Strategy 2017-2022: Theme 6: Evaluate the impact, benefits and risks of the Open Data Initiative and benchmark against other jurisdictions. This outlines “the development of metrics that allow benefits capture, for example, what contribution Open Data makes to improve efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery. Carry out and publish an evaluation of the impact, benefits and risks of the Open Data Initiative. Consider evaluation frameworks in use in other jurisdictions which address benefits and return on investment”.

Consultation with stakeholders is taking place on the next National Open Data Strategy and it is envisaged that the impact of open data will be a key area, especially in relation to high value datasets.";;;;20
34;yes;" Defining metrics to measure data use or impact can be difficult, especially if what is being measured is  subjective, for example, data quality. However, there are a number of indicators that can be
automated and consistently reviewed to measure data access, such as dataset views and downloads
on a data catalogue. For example, data.gov.ie uses Fathom Analytics to record dataset page views and downloads. If a publisher publishes data via an API, the number of API requests can be measured to better understand usage. 

Impact stories and Showcases on the Portal provide examples of use and demonstrate the potential of open data, facilitating wider access to the data, and can encourage further use of the data. Examples can be provided by the publisher directly, or contributed by other users with the support of the publisher.  https://data.gov.ie/showcase/active-travel-counts

In order to evaluate the impact of Ireland’s Open Data Initiative, both a macro and mirco approach will be taken.  A macro impact evaluation will examine the broad outcomes of the initiative from a social, political and economic perspective.   At a micro level particular case-studies can be explored to get a clear understanding of the impact of Open Data in specific sectors and under a certain set of conditions.   The development of the case studies and the research itself may necessitate the researcher surveying businesses, open data users and other relevant parties.  It will also include the drafting, publishing and assessment of surveys and the organising of interviews with data re-users.

On Friday the 24th of February, Smart Dublin, an organisation founded by the four Dublin Local Authorities, partnered up with Google and Aclima, to launch a weekend- long Hackathon focused on improving air quality. It was the largest Air Quality Data Hack Ireland has ever seen. Air quality is a serious challenge facing our cities and one that not only affects the environment, but society as a whole. Over the last 16 months, equipped with Aclima’s air sensing platform, Google we able to collect over 50 million records at 5 million locations of street level air quality data for Dublin.Over the 3 days of the Hackathon, more than 100 participants gathered in the Dublin Google Offices and spent the weekend hacking these 50 million measurements of air quality data collected as part of the ‘Google Air View Dublin’ project. The aim was for the participants, spread across 16 teams, to come up with ways to help tackle air pollution in Dublin, given the hyperlocal, rich open data collected. This open data is available to view on Google’s Environmental Insights Explorer and on Smart Dublin’s open data platform and by making this data accessible and open, we hope to see local government, businesses and the general public working collaboratively to improve air quality for Dublin.

The event was a great success, with teams coming up with innovative and imaginative solutions that could certainly help tackle air quality in Ireland. https://data.gov.ie/blog/smart-dublin-hackathon

We have 'Featured' datasets those that are kept at the top of the list because they are deemed to be important in some way. This makes discovering them much easier.   We create data collections manually. for example, the Covid banner on the front page. This effectively curates mini-collections by associating datasets together.   ";;;;10

91;the majority of public sector data providers;"All PSBs who release open data are connected to the portal.  PBs who wish to release data will contact the ODU in the first instance.  They will be directed to the OD technical guidance documents on the portal which set out requirements for publishing to the portal including the CC By 4.0  licence, the metadata required and the accepted open formats.
The PB will be set up as a publisher on the national portal and supported by the ODU to publish their data.  
Where harvesting of data can be initiated or APIs implemented the PB will liaise with the technical support supplier to the ODU to put these services in place. 
Most public service bodies do publish their data, the few who don't may not have tha capacity to publish yet or have little data to release due to GDPR concerns.  We are actively working with them to address these issues.  
There is a network of Open Data Liaison Officers across public service organisations- the Open Data Unit is in regular contact with this network to support them and encourage them to publish their data in open format.

A new Open Data Training framework was put in place in early 2022.  The courses which this training framework provides includes a course on the Publication of open Data. So far this year in 2023 there have been multiple training days on Data Audits and Data Publication.";;;;12

92b;yes, or all public sector data providers already publish data;"Training courses have been put in place under the new Open Data Training Framework for the public service.  There have been 2 rounds of these training days so far this year-2023. These include:
1. General Introduction to Open Data
2. Open Data & Re-Use of Public Service Information (PSI Directive)  – Implications for public bodies
3. Open Data Audits and Data Publication
4. Introduction to Data Analytics and Visualisations
5. Data Anonymisation Techniques
6. Introduction to Linked Data 

There are also a number of actions the ODU takes to assist PBs to publish data. 
We meet these public service bodies to promote open data training, auditing and the publication of their data.  When PBs want to start pulishing data we will meet with them to guide them through the publication process and on their request they will be set up as a publisher on the national portal.
The Data Autit Tool on the Portal provides a mechanism for organisations to identify and catalogue what datasets they hold.  The Tool enables PBs to list and describe all datasets that exist within their organisation, so that the datasets can be reviewed and those that are suitable for publication as Open Data can be selected and approved. These datasets can then be published directly on data.gov.ie.

PBs are directed to the guides and documentation available on the portal that explains the steps and requirements they should complete to publish their data, such as https://data.gov.ie/docs/Open-Data-Publication-Guidelines-2021.pdf and https://data.gov.ie/uploads/page_images/2018-08-08-164247.606489Add-a-Dataset-to-Portal-Guide---August-2018.pdf

Data publishers who have relatively small amounts of datasts to publish can publish directly to the portal using the ‘add a dataset’ function.
Where PBs have large volumes of data or datasets that are updated regularly and harvesting of data can be initiated or APIs implemented the PB will liaise with the technical support supplier to the ODU to put these services in place. 
We also hold information webinars and an annual conference to promote the publication and reuse of data.";;;;10

This includes several harvesters that manage data from a number of different public bodies i.e. the ISDE, GeoHive and CSO harvesters manage data from a number of smaller organisations in addition to their own.  This ensures an extra layer of data checking and verification and that data updates are regularly made.    Smaller public bodies with fewer open datasets publish their data manually, but the upload process ensures that the metadata is required in the correct format for the process to be completed.
