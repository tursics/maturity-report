* If yes, please provide (1) the URL and (2) title of the policy document and briefly describe.
* If ‘other’, please provide (1) a brief explanation to support your answer choice and (2) provide the URL and indicate the policy section which explicitly references open data.";yes;"Yes, there is an open data law at federal level. In July 2017, Section 12a of the E-Government Act (EGovG) entered into force (First Open Data Act), which for the first time created a legal basis for the mandatory provision of open administrative data by federal authorities. The Second Open Data Act, which entered into force in July 2021, further adapted the content of the existing obligations under Section 12a of the EGovG and extended them to the entire federal administration.

The Data Use Act (DNG) which also entered into force on 23 July 2021 aims to modernise and replace the Information Re-Use Act (IWG). In order to improve the usability of data, open data will need to be used in machine-readable formats. In addition, the DNG stimulates open data initiatives beyond the boundaries of the federal administration and establishes the principle of ‘open by default’ also for the use of data by the Länder, municipalities and public undertakings in the areas of water, transport and energy supply. The DNG also transposes EU Directive 2019/1024 (Open Data and Public Sector Information-Directive), which was recast in 2019.

The Federal Government’s Open Data Strategy, adopted on 6 July 2021, provides a framework for action to improve the Federal Open Data Ecosystem. The Federal Government’s data strategy forms the overarching data policy framework for the Open Data Strategy. Over a period of five years, the Open Data Strategy covers three areas of action, with a total of 68 implementation measures taken by different federal ministries and authorities. The three strands of action include improving the provision of data and developing data infrastructures, increasing innovative, public-interest and responsible use of data, and promoting data literacy and a data culture to increase the quality and usability of data provided. The implementation of the Open Data Strategy is accompanied by continuous monitoring.";The answer option 'Not applicable' can be selected if e.g. there is no specific strategy in place, but the existing policy refers to the objectives, actions/measures to be implemented, delivery timelines, responsible etc. Should another explanation apply in your case, please provide it in the justification text box.;;;;30

For Justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the main changes. ";yes;"The Open Data Strategy itself not: The Open Data Strategy is currently in its implementation phase (until 2025).

BUT: The data strategy of federal governance, from which the Open Data Strategy is directly derived (see also the answer to question 2), is currently being further developed. This follows a corresponding mandate from the coalition agreement of the current Federal Government. This includes also basic elements of open data implementation (e.g. calls for more open data to be provided by the federal administration; the implementation of the previous Open Data Strategy remains in place).
The planned update of the data strategy is currently being discussed and revised within the Federal Government. As a result, up-to-date information of the latest developments is not yet available but is expected to be submitted by autumn.

Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz)
For an example of an open data policy see: https://www.landesrecht.rlp.de/bsrp/document/jlr-TranspGRPrahmen 
The Rhineland-Palatinate State Transparency Act (LTranspG) came into force on January 1, 2016. It regulates access to “information”, this means official information and environmental information. The law provides for an application procedure according to which anyone can request access to information present from any so-called transparency-obligated body (this includes all Rhineland-Palatinate authorities, insofar as they carry out administrative activities). Furthermore, the law regulates that the information defined in a definite list in § 7 para. 1 and 2 LTranspG must be published proactively (officially, without having to submit an application) by the bodies subject to transparency obligations. The place of publication is an electronic platform, the so-called transparency platform, provided by the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate. In addition to the Transparency Act the government of Rhineland-Palatinate is planning on initiating an open data policy similar to the one at federal level  in order to ensure that even more government data is available to the public free of charge and in a standardized, machine-readable form. In this context, the adoption of an open data strategy is also envisaged.

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly specify.";yes;"Regarding the national level:
The data strategy contains several measures specifing a data inventory, e.g.:
- Verwaltungsdateninformationsplattform (VIP); published by the Federal statistical office: https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Staat/Buerokratiekosten/VIP/vip.html
- Datenatlas (this includes an inventory analysis of all the administration’s data), see:

- A measure of the Open Data Strategy: the Competence Center Open Data (CCOD) at the Federal Office of Administration has developed a prototype of a ""theme catalogue"" of open data. (https://opendatabund.github.io/themenkataloge/)

Regarding the regional / communal level:
Due to consitutional restrictions in Germany owing to Germany's Federal structure (Bund on the national level and the 16 Länder), the national government cannot directly mandate the federal states (Länder) or communes/cities and their respective public bodies to maintain a data inventory. However, within the limits of the German constitution, the national government has issued a law that specifies which data that must be published as open data (§12a). 
This is due to constitutional restraints (verfassungsrechtliche Hürden) but incentives were used e.g. in programmes to support local and regional initiatives (Modellkommunen/ Model Municipalities BMI) as well as dialogue formats with all regions and local authorities.

""Open machine-readable data, especially in real time, offer great potential for innovative business models for the private sector, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups. At the same time, open data means that administrative processes become more effective, transparent and comprehensible. Open data have a positive impact focus on civic participation and civil society, foster trust in governance and form the basis for value creation and innovation.

;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;470
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

Please select the answer from the drop down options in the `Answer` column. If applicable, please provide additional information to justify the selected answer in the `Justification` column.

* If possible, please provide a URL to a public document describing it.";yes;"Yes, but there is no one-size-fits-all definition of the impact of open data in Germany (which would, due to the constitutional division between federal level (Bund) and regional level (Länder) as mentioned above, hardly be applicable to Germany): most public bodies and institutions dealing with open data have delineated what the impact of open data (can) entail from their perspective.
- For instance, the overall impact of open data is described in the Data Stategy (see here https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1845634/f073096a398e59573c7526feaadd43c4/datenstrategie-der-bundesregierung-download-bpa-data.pdf?download=1.
- The Open data Strategy also contains a broad definition of the objectives and impacts of open data (page 5, 6), see URL: https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1940386/1d269a2ad1b6346fcf60663bdea9c9f8/2021-07-07-open-data-strategie-data.pdf?download=1
- Open data is a key aspect of the mFUND funding program. Innovation projects are supported financially that make their project results and research data available as open data at the latest after the project has ended. BMVI's open data portal mCLOUD (https://mcloud.de/) is the primary repository for the publication of open data for mFUND projects. The scope of the planned open data provision already plays a decisive role in the assessment of the submitted project proposals.
- A number of federal agencies have implented Open Data in all data relevant processes and in their strategic orientation (change management), e.g. BAW, BSH, DWD.
- The study  ""Kommunales Open Government. Gebrauchsanleitung für eine Utopie"" published by the  Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community moreover presents several concrete expectations of positive impact thanks to open government data (URL: https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/veroeffentlichungen/themen/moderne-verwaltung/leitfaden-modellkommune-open-govt.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1) 
-  In the course of the Ministry's project ""Modellkomune Open Government"", eight impact dimensions of openness and nine expected impacts for public bodies were identified (see pp. 61 & p. 65, URL:  https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/veroeffentlichungen/themen/moderne-verwaltung/projektbericht-modellkommune-open-government.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2)

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the key points of this methodology.";yes;"As impact is defined in different ways (see Q33 above), there are different methodologies used on the national, regional, local and project-level. 
- On the national level, the implementation and corresponding impact of the open data law is measured through an online questionnaire and writing of a bi-annual ""Fortschrittsbericht"" (Progress report). See the first one and also the results of the mearung here: https://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/141/1914140.pdf
*(the second report is currently being prepared).
- The State (Land) NRW has developed a through evaluation for its overall open government strategy, which includes measuring its open-data-goals and the associated impact (URL: 
https://www-open-nrw.prod-drupal.nrw.de/system/files/media/document/file/opennrwt1web.pdf) 
- The project ""Modellkomune Open Government"" published an accompanying guidebook that specifies ""expectations"" associated with openness and concrete steps to achieve them. These are at the same time the basis for impact evaluation (URL: https://open-government-kommunen.de/goto.php?target=file_425_download&client_id=civitalis) 
- the Open Data Impact Award of the Stifterverband suggests that ""impact"" of open data in research means that the data has successfully been implemented in another societal field (creating an added value for society, openly available for a large number of users) (URL: https://www.stifterverband.org/innosci/open-data-impact-award)

Finally: in its coalition agreement from 2021, the Federal Government stipulated the establishment of an independent data institute in Germany. One task of this institution will be in future to develop further methods.";With methodology we refer to practices, frameworks, methods developed/employed, regardless of their maturity level.;;;;30

- there is funding and other activities to promote research data management with the goal to make this high quality data accessible through the FAIR-principles for the benefit of science, business and civil society.

- In the mFUND program there are a number of projects that emerge from civil society engagement. One example is the project miki (""mobil im Kiez"", https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/miki.html), that aims to develop solutions for the navigation and orientation of people with reduced mobility under participation of civil society engagement. In total there are 15 mFUND-projects under participation of civil society organizations that use open data and/ or create open data.

- OParl is an initiative to promote the openness of parliamentary information systems at municipal level in Germany, see: https://oparl.org/

- There are currently 34 so called ""OK Labs"" all over germany which operate under the leadership of Code for Germany. These Labs work with open data on a daily basis and create several projects, applications and use cases. See an overview of the labs here:

* If applicable, please provide the URL to the documentation of the national DCAT-AP extension.";yes;"DCAT-AP.de is only complement to DCAT-AP, so it is completely conforming to DCAT-AP. The complement to DCAT-AP are necessary to depict German peculiarities.
https://www.dcat-ap.de/ // R2: For an exact explanation, we would have to answer the question separately.

In short, there are two legally different approaches between the CC BY 4.0 licence and the German data licence. CC BY focuses on material property law, while the German variant classifies the licensing of (official) datasets as a dedication/administrative act. This results in a different legal assessment. In addition, there are aspects from the regulations in Germany regarding general terms and conditions (GTC) in the context of civil law.

So there is a subtle legal distinction behind the data licence - a ""German peculiarity"". :-)

Nevertheless, the necessity of a national licence is currently being discussed and possibly reassessed in future.";;;"Out of interest, will you please describe the ""German perculiarities""";;5
