1;yes;"The Open Data Directive was adopted in Estonia as a legislative act called Public Information Act (PIA) https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/510122021005/consolide/current .  This piece of legislation regulates data publishing in Estonia, including regulations regarding open data publishing, re-use of open data, high-value datasets, etc; There is also the Green Paper on Machine-Readable Open Government Data, which gives guidelines on open data publishing https://www.riha.ee/api/v1/systems/eaatv/files/cdbfa8bd-2594-8ad3-6022-ff3d3dbf6781";;;;30
2;yes;Our Open Data Action Plan was recently renewed and covers actions and strategic goals for years 2023-2024. New action plan is yet to be approved by the government, so it isn't publicly available yet. The main highlights of the plan include actions and strategies in 4 dimensions (public sector, private sector, education and legislation) with a focus on upskilling public officials, publishing open data and its quality improvement, as well as open data reuse growth. The general goals (publishing public sector data as open by default) are stipulated in the Public Information Act: https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/510122021005/consolide/current. (includes the goal of fostering open access to publicly funded research data among other known principals from the OD PSI Directive). Previous Open Data and Data Management action plans for 2021-2022 are available on the national open data portal https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/instructions/action-plans-for-open-data-and-data-management-2021-2022.;;;;30
3;yes;Yes, the Open Data Action plan was updated for the new period 2023-2024, previous action plan covered years 2021-2022. The new action plan should be viewed as a continuation of the old one with a stronger focus on the data reuse as well as actios related to data publication. It also gives a better overview of the current situation, main challenges and strategical perspective of the planned actions.;;;;10
4;yes;Digital transformation is handled on all levels. There are agencies and municipalities, which include topics related to digitalization and open data in their strategies. For example The Development Strategy Tallinn 2035 (https://strateegia.tallinn.ee/) includes goals on spatial data like making them more available. Environmental Board strategy 2022–2025 (https://keskkonnaamet.ee/en/media/3613/download) has separate chapter dedecated to open data, where they underline the importance of the freely available data high of quality and its impact on boosting innovation and making informed decisions. Similar tendecies can be notices across over agencies as well.;;;;10
5;yes;The Open Data Action plan 2023-2024 includes concrete actions divided into quarters for the next two years in a four main categories - public sector, private sector, education and legislation. Activities include, but are not limited to, upskilling public officials, further developments of the national open data portal, events, communication, support of the open data projects, support of open data publication and its reuse etc.;;;;25
6a;yes;We have activities to incentivise the publication of and access to open data (e.g. make more data colected and available via API). Recommendations for data providers on how to provide open data, including dynamic data, have been published at https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/instructions/avaandmete-loomise-juhend. In addition, the EU Structural Funds funding scheme for public sector IT developments requires open data to be provided according to user needs.;;;;15
6b;yes;Together with the Ministry of Finance we continue working on a project, which will allow to collect and publish geo-spatial data from and for municipalities. Moreover, according to action plan we are preparing to regulate high-value data sets in the Public Information Act, which also include geo-spatial data.;;;;15
6c;yes;"One of the goals of Estonia’s Digital Agenda 2030 (https://www.mkm.ee/media/6970/download) is achieving human-centric digital government. To achive that we plan to raise the awareness of people and the general public of human-centric digital government and the reliability of technology. Our Open Data Action plan includes activities on creating and keeping up-to-date e-courses including topics of open data, which describe open data concept, publication process, and reuse both for public oficials and citizens. Moreover, we constanly working on raising user-friendliness of our open data national portal and making data publishing as easy as possible.
====
To help boost publication to data generated by citizens we have created online courses at our government digital academy on open data and its publication (https://digiriigiakadeemia.ee/), we also carry out trainings on specific fields. We have carried out trainings on data literacy, which we plan to roll-out across the nation to raise competences and awareness. Today, this is covered in our digital-centric data governance vision and agenda. From technical means, we have created consent service, which enables citizens to share their government held data with external stakeholders. Today, over 300 000 consents have been generated to enable access to citizen data. 

There are also domain specific activities to incentivse publication and access to data generated by citizens. For instance, eBiodiversity (https://elurikkus.ee/en), which operates much on citizen generated data to understand biodiversity in Estonia, nation-wide campaigns are ran to incentivse. We carried out Donate your Speech campaign to incentivise people to make their speech data available as open data (https://oecd-opsi.org/blog/estonians-donate-a-speech-preserving-language-and-driving-digital-service-delivery/). Similarly, there are other initiatives related to weather, trash, energy consumption, infrastructure which incentivise publication/access to citizen generated data.";;Please comment on any measures that incentivise the publication/access to data generated by citizens;;15

National portal has separate use-cases page https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/usage-stories.";;;;15
30;yes;Use-cases of open data can be found through national portal, page called use-cases (https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/usage-stories). As well, natinal portal provides information on the number of dataset's downloads, which can indirectly indicate the level of re-use. We also discuss use-cases during monthly working group meetings, where authorities present their use-cases. Use-cases are also shared during big annual event - Open Data Forum. ;;;;20
31;yes;One of the means to encourage pubic bodies to reuse open data is annual competition, where  we select best data publishers, best reuse cases and best visualization cases. During the year we are trying to find the most noticeable/valuable cases to make a shortlist in 3 categories. Digtal voting is open for everyone and we distribute an information about the competition via our mailing lists, social media and through our events. Winners get an award from the ministry, usually we present books on the topic reletad to data. Winners as well get marked on our portal.  After we winners have been choosen, they are invited to share their knowledge in our data working group meeting.

33;yes;The Information Society Strategy (https://www.mkm.ee/media/6970/download) the impact of data and its meaning is covered in many points: 1) data-driven state where any decision is based on data and that is reached by re-using data (pg 14), 2) Consent Service (https://github.com/e-gov/NT/blob/master/EN.md) and the economic impact to be had from sharing your personal data. Not open data but it still emphasizes the importance of data re-use because of its economic potential (pg 18). MoEAC has defined impact through use cases where opening up has had any type of impact.;;;;20
34;yes;"Our methodology is heavily centered around use cases/user stories because we had a discussion about measuring impact with numbers being the centre of it all, but it is very difficult to assign ""a price"" to a dataset. MoEAC and Statistics Estonia composed a questionnaire made up of 7 questions that ranged from defining the profile of a data re-users (to basically understand your customer) to actual examples they know of that are stemmed from their agency's datasets.
This  year we plan to carry out a procurement to analyze the impact of open data in Estonia, overall value of open data, and creat methodology for further measurments.";;;;30

39a;yes;"The MoEAC doing it through meet-ups with other public sector representatives, NGOs, academia, and private sector.

The following answer was partial from our end. A key part in collecting reuse cases is through yearly data maturity assessment, where public bodies are required to provide information on reuse cases, an overview of last years maturity assessment can be found in https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/instructions/public-sector-impact-assessment-of-open-data-2022. We also carry out assessment in the private sector. During the last assessment, we involved roughly 2000 Estonian companies representing different areas and sizes for representative purposes, in addition to interviewing and meeting with representative bodies, universities and clusters. These are regular activities we do to understand private  sector, NGO and other stakeholder needs and requirements regarding open data. During the meetups, focus group interviews and 1-1 interviews, we collect information on data re-use, stakeholder needs, investment requirements and so forth.";;Please elaborate on this approach. How do you gather reuse cases systematic through these meet-ups?;;20
39b;yes;"Data classification in Estonia is mainly based on the areas data-based solutions impact. On our national open data portal we tend to collect the main reuse cases, so they would be accessible from one place.

The following answer was partial on our-end. For reuse cases we classifify specifically based on the geographic areas the use-cases cover and which public body data has been mainly used for the reuse case. The data itself is tied to 12 areas, that is, science and technology, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and food, energy, environment, population and society, economy and finances, justice, legal system and public safety, health, government and public sector, education, culture and sport, transport and regions and cities.";;"For a full understanding/clearer definition, please provide examples of the ""areas data-based solutions impact"".";;10
D2.3;;;;;;320
D2.3a;;;;;;80
40;yes;"Main impact includes government being more efficient and transparent. Also, we see an increasing trend on data-driven decision/making on governmental level. We notice that enteties tend to have more willingness to develope technologies and find the ways of solving problems using data. 
The impact can be monitored mostly by the reuse. Open data reuse is very popular internally within the organization: many institutions have created interesting usage stories based on their open data, the most common of which are data visualizations. There are institutions that have found that they help non-thematic parties to better interpret very specific data and thus alleviate the institution's workload of clarifying the data logic.  Reuse cases can be found on our national portal in the use cases section https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/usage-stories. The number of use cases is constantly growing.  
Every year we carry out an impact assessment of open data and data managment in the public sector, results are published on our open data portal (on estonian language). Year 2022  - https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/instructions/avaandmete-mojuhinnang-avalikus-sektoris-2022

The yearly impact assessments are a systematic study, not anecdotal. Which are in addition assisted with additional studies and impact assessment requirements for public bodies. There are examples in all ministries and areas, where impact has been created and measured. For instance, Estonian Agricultural Registry is using satellite data (open data available through esthub) to verify whether the grasslands have been mowed to automate and support decision-making capacity, transportation authority is using open data to understand the likelihood of traffic accidents happening and plan investments to improve traffic management, Tallinn is using open data gathered through crowdsourcing to plan public investments in road maintenance and planning (https://gis.tallinn.ee/andmekorje/?fbclid=IwAR14eN87q_KGScM_E8jJVHHPdbOUdKnUKsss3rD-a24dFMZYMosQZ-JH_aU), and so forth. 

For instance, in the traffic accident likelihood project, we understood what are the key factors that contribute to the traffic accidents and how likely it is that traffic accidents take place, the F1 score was for specific classes (road which are less likely to have any major accidents and thus need intervention) was 0.98794618 and so forth. In the agriculture use-cases, the precision is roughly 85%, which means in most cases the public official doesn’t need to do on-site inspections, thus contributing to efficiency.";;It is not clear if this information is anecdotal or based on research in the impact study.

From our side we conduct different projects, which bring together public and private sector or create some other value.  
In advance, the impact is monitored mostly by the re-use cases of open data. The number of external uses reported to us is lower, but this is often also due to the fact that institutions often do not know how exactly the data has been re-used. The profile of the users is known, but the exact cases of use are not. In most cases, open data is also published under such a license that, in the case of re-use, it is not necessary to refer to the owner, so it is not possible to fully identify all usage stories – especially those where several data sets are interconnected. Some of them are brought below https://avaandmed.eesti.ee/usage-stories . The number of use cases is constantly growing.

57;yes;"1) Project on calculating the height of a forest. The Environment Agency and KEMIT have, together with a development partner, created a remote sensing information system for forests which enables records of forest resources to be kept in a geo-referenced manner, and forest information to be collected and shared in an operative manner. The created solution is semi-automatic, being partially based on machine learning algorithms, partially on the visual verification of remote sensing data, and partially on the software solutions of third parties. Remote sensing data are mainly used as primary data, but forest notifications, soil maps, and other such data (including teaching and validation data) also act as inputs. The processing will create Estonia-wide map layers about more important survey characteristics, such as a raster map about the height of woody flora (for calculation of the average height of the forest).
2) Water level monitoring in coastal seas and lakes, using satellite altimetry. Project includes hydrological operative monitoring of the satellite information on flooding; resource charge verification in peat deposits, using radar remote sensing data; and water level remote sensing data for improving hydrological monitoring and sea forecast services. Hydrological monitoring includes on-site measurements of water levels and flow rates at national hydrometry stations. This overview provides an opportunity to verify the data reflected in the resource charge declaration. When combined, the water level remote sensing prototypes enable remote sensing data, the forecast model, and artificial intelligence, to be used to ensure better water level information for interested parties and the public. Integrating altimetry data into hydrological monitoring would help to improve the spatial coverage of surveying on major lakes and improve the accuracy of sea level forecasting.";;;;20
