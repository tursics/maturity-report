The Three-year Plan for Information Technology in Public Administration is the national strategic document for all Public Administrations that oversees the digital transformation of the country [ https://www.agid.gov.it/it/agenzia/piano-triennale and https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/piano_triennale_per_linformatica_nella_pa_2022-2024.pdf]. The Plan is an important document to promote the digital transformation of the country and, in particular, that one of the Italian Public Administration, through the declination of the strategy on digitization into operational indications, such as objectives and expected results, traceable to the administrative action of PAs. Within the Three-Year Plan, a specific chapter (Chapter 2) is dedicated to Data of the public administration. In line with the principles set out and in continuity with the actions started with the previous Plans, the latest update 2022-2024 of this Three-Year Plan aims at ensuring greater effectiveness of administrative activity in all processes involving the use of data, both with reference to the sharing of data between public administrations for institutional purposes, and with reference to the re-use of data, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes, according to the open data paradigm. The chapter includes specific objectives, expected results and actions to achieve those objectives also in line with the arrangements of the Open Data Directive, the national transposition act and the Guidelines on open data introduced by the national legislation.
The objectives and the related expected results about data and open data included in the Three-Year Plan are as follows:
OB.2.1 - Promote data sharing among PAs and reuse by citizens and businesses
- R.A.2.1a - Increase the number of databases of national interest available through APIs consistent with the interoperability model and national and European data model.
- R.A.2.1b - Increasing the number of open dynamic datasets consistent with the provisions of Directive (EU) 2019/1024 with particular reference to their publication through APIs
- R.A.2.1c - Increasing the number of spatial datasets made available through the network services under Directive 2007/2/EC (INSPIRE).
OB.2.2 - Increase the quality of data and metadata.
- R.A.2.2a - Increase the number of datasets with quality metadata complying with the European and national reference standards
- R.A.2.2b - Increasing the number of open datasets made available by public administrations
OB.2.3 - Increasing awareness of policies to enhance the value of information assets public and on a modern data economy
- R.A.2.3b - Increase the number of open datasets available with the licenses provided for by the Open Data Guidelines (CC BY 4.0 and CC0)

The article 50-ter of the Digital Administration Code (CAD) [ https://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:2005-03-07;82  ], with the aim of redesigning digital governance, speeding up the digitization of public services and simplifying relations between citizens and the public administration, among other provision, foreseen the adoption of a National Data Strategy, by subsequent decree of the President of the Council of Ministers. 
The aforementioned article of the CAD, among other things, is a strong boost to the availability and interoperability of data of public administrations and public service undertakings, as well as the consolidation of the API catalogue, within the National Digital Data Platform established by the abovementioned art. 50-ter itself.

Furthermore, in line with the provisions of the action plan for EU eGovernment 2016-2020 (COM (2016) 179 final, and new European interoperability framework (COM (2017) 134 final, particular attention is given to the need for better coordination between various data policies, in particular for the implementation of the INSPIRE directive in the context of eGoverment policies. 
On this basis, the Three Years Plan highlights that the spatial information follows the implementing rules of the INSPIRE directive with regard to data harmonization, data access services, interoperability models, etc., whereas it is necessary to follow the rules of the implementation of the Open Data directive for everything concerning the conditions for data re-use (licensing, pricing, etc.).

The “Protocol for data management and Open Data” document, adopted in the “Data and Open Data Management Working Group” of the Steering Committee for the coordination of “OT11 and OT2” interventions within the framework of the Italian Partnership Agreement, includes a list of actions for the public administrations in the context of a national strategy in this area (see  https://ot11ot2.it/  and http://network.ot11ot2.it/sites/default/files/opendata1_elementi_tecnici_e_strategie_v4_0.pdf https://ot11ot2.it/linee-guida-e-protocolli/protocollo-data-e-open-data-management).
Inter alia, the document includes a dynamic “Basket of key datasets” -” (available for the download) annually updated. This “basket” is the basis for the calculation of the indicator 2RIS ""Number of public databases available as open data (in percent) on the public databases of a selected basket"" as defined in the 2014-2020 Partnership Agreement and to be published until 2023; at the same time, it is also a qualitative indicator with reference to the implementation of open data strategy (see https://www.dati.gov.it/monitoraggio/paniere-dataset).
The ""Basket"" is basically based on some  priority datasets, identified through the activities carried out over the years and in any case referred to: i) the government commitments (as the Italian Action Plan for G8 Open Data Charter), ii) the initiatives of the administrations, iii) the requests of the stakeholders, iv) the proposals emerged in the context of the ""Data and Open data management"" Working Area of the OT11-OT2 network, v) the commitments undertaken in the context of the Open Government Partnership (Action Plan of the OGP in the Open Data and Transparency theme), vi) the strategy of reference outlined with the Three-Year ICT Plan.

6a;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to real-time or dynamic data?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"A specific expected result in the section dedicated to data in the Three Year Plan for ICT in the PA [https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/piano_triennale_per_linformatica_nella_pa_2022-2024.pdf]  
concerns the increasing of the number of dynamic open datasets consistent with the provisions of Directive (EU) 2019/1024, with particular reference to their publication in open and machine-readable format through APIs. The targets set are:
Target 2023 - Documentation in the national open data catalog of at least 300 dynamic datasets.
Target 2024 - Documentation in the national open data catalog of at least 400 dynamic datasets.
To reach those targets, the PAs and the undertakings fulfilling public services are required to identify the dynamic datasets to be opened and published in accordance with Directive (EU) 2019/1024 and document them in the national data portals.

Linked to that, the Legislative Decree no. 36/2006, as amended by the Legislative Decree no. 200/2021 transposing the Directive 2019/1024, includes specific provisions for dynamic data. Furthermore, the Guidelines for the implementation of that Decree define further specific arrangements, including requirements and recommendations, for the publication and the access to dynamic data (see https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/lg-open-data_v.1.0_1.pdf).";Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time). ;;;;15
6b;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to geo-spatial data (e.g. in relation to high-value datasets as specified in the implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138)?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"In the Three-Year Plan for ICT in the PA [https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/piano_triennale_per_linformatica_nella_pa_2022-2024.pdf]   a specific expected result concerns the increasing of the number of spatial datasets made available through network services under Directive 2007/2/EC (INSPIRE). 
The targets set are:
Target 2023 - Documentation in the National Catalogue for Spatial Data of at least 2500 datasets.
Target 2024 - Documentation in the National Catalogue for Spatial Data of at least 3000 datasets. 

As the National Catalogue for Spatial Data is interoperable with the National Data Portal dati.gov.it, then if geo-spatial data are also open data, then they are automatically discoverable through the National data Portal.

In addition, in Italy there is a specific regulatory framework for geospatial data (integrated in the data policy and established by law) including, inter alia:
“Guidelines for the implementation of the GeoDCAT-AP specification”- to implement in Italy the specification defined under the ISA / ISA2 programme, for enabling and ensuring access to geodata, also through the national open data portal (see https://geodati.gov.it/geoportale/documenti/12-documenti/277-linee-guida-nazionali-geodcat-ap);
""Guidelines about technical rules for the definition and updating of the content of the National Catalogue for Spatial Data"" (see https://agid.github.io/geodocs/rndt-lg/2.0.1/ );
Technical specifications for data models also extending the INSPIRE data specifications (see https://geodati.gov.it/geoportale/datiterritoriali/regole-tecniche).

Linked to that, the Legislative Decree no. 36/2006, as amended by the Legislative Decree no. 200/2021 transposing the Directive 2019/1024, establishes that in case of spatial data, it shall follow the rules defined under the INSPIRE Directive and the provisions defined with Open Data Directive for the conditions for reuse.
The Guidelines for the implementation of that Decree define further specific arrangements, including requirements and recommendations, for the publication and the access to geo-spatial data, also in case such geo-spatial data are High Value Datasets (see https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/lg-open-data_v.1.0_1.pdf). 
For the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2023/138, a working group is being established to draft an operational guide.";"Geo-spatial data is data that contains information on properties that are linked to a position on earth.

6c;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to citizen-generated data?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"The Fifth OGP National Action Plan includes a specific action for the pubblication of open data (in open and machine-readable format) about the public tenders, where the civil society is fully engaged (see https://open.gov.it/sites/default/files/media/documents/2022-03/5nap-piano-azione-governo-aperto-italia.pdf).

RESPONSE TO THE REVIEWER
The action includes the following steps:
- reconnaissance of currently existing data sources that can complement that of ANAC (the anti-corruption authority) on public tenders to best cover the information needs of civil society;
- Integration of ANAC data with other data sources - e.g.: OpenCUP (that makes available data, in open format, on public investment decisions financed with national, community or regional public funds or private resources registered with the Unique Project Code), OpenCoesione (open government initiative on cohesion policies in Italy with the aim of promoting the effectiveness of interventions through the publication of data on funded projects and widespread civic participation.);  possibility of synergies with the ""participation"" action and civic debate. 
This action will be in charge of civil society organizations and aims to make the results of empowerment concrete: ANAC will play the role of the facilitator;
- collection of feedback, suggestions for improvement of data portals;
- Updating or extending the semantic content published;
- publication of APIs.

The action also includes the integration of data 
coming from civic monitoring (i.e. citizen-generated data) on projects receiving support from public resources. Civic monitoring means collecting data, evidence, information, news, interviewing actors involved in the design and implementation of interventions, visiting places and construction sites, fostering transparency and collaboration, and making proposals.
";Citizen-generated data is the data that people or their organisations produce to directly monitor, demand or drive change on issues that affect them.;;"Please clarify how this example about public tenders refers to citizen-generated data (see ""Guide to Answering for definition)";;15
6d;"Does the national strategy/policy foster the discoverability of the aforementioned types of data from your country on data.europa.eu?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe how.";yes;"As both national catalogues (open data portal and catalogue for spatial data) are harvested by data.europa.eu, all data documented in those catalogues are also discoverable in data.europa.eu. Consequently, this affects also the aforementioned types of data, as, based on specific actions and requirements in the Three-Year Plan for ICT, PAs are required to document data in the mentioned catalogues.

The Legislative Decree No. 36/2006 (amended by the Legislative Decree No. 200/2021 transposing the Directive (UE) 2019/1024) includes a specific provision for documenting data falling within the scope of the Open Data Directive and the related transposing Decree (so also dynamic data, geospatial data, etc.), through metadata, in the aforementioned catalogues. 
Furthermore, the Guidelines for the implementation of the National Open Data Decree (transposing the Open Data Directive) explicitly mention the European portal data.europa.eu.

Finally, in case of geospatial data the creation and publication of metadata are mandatory based on specific law (art. 59 of the Digital Administration Code). In case of geospatial data also available as open data, metadata documented in the catalogue for spatial data are also made available in the open data portal through GeoDCAT-AP. In order to avoid duplications in data.europa.eu portal, a filter is applied to the endpoint for excluding metadata for spatial data (already harvested from the national catalogue for spatial data).";;;;;10
7;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to support the reuse of open data by the public sector?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"The Article 50 of the Digital Administration Code (CAD) [ http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:2005-03-07;82!vig= ] expressly states that the data of public administrations are formed, collected, stored, made available and accessible through the use of information and communication technologies that allow their use and re-use by other public administrations and by private (citizens, businesses …), in accordance with the conditions established by law.

The subsequent article 52 also provides, with reference to reuse by the public sector, that in the definition of the specifications or the outlines of the contracts, relating to products and services that involve the production, collection and management of data, the administrations provide for suitable clauses to allow the use, in accordance with the provisions of (aforementioned) art. 50.
Furthermore, the same article 52 provides that the activities aimed at ensuring the access and re-use of public administration data fall within the parameters for assessing managerial performance.
The same article 52, to support the re-use of open data by the public and private sector, establishes the principle “Open data by default”.

Moreover, in Italy, almost all Regions and many municipalities have their own “policy to support the reuse of open data”. [ https://www.dati.gov.it/riferimenti-normativi-linee-guida-regionali ] 
In general, these administrations proceed with the adoption of dedicated policies and local guidelines for the effective implementation of the national strategy on the territory.
In this regard, it should be noted that in order to harmonize the process of exploiting public data (at national, regional and local level) the strategy defined by the individual administrations has to comply with the strategy set out in the Three-Year Plan, resulting in disciplinary liability and economic damage in case of non-compliance (L. 208/2015, art.1, co 512-517).
[ http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:legge:2015-12-28;208!vig= ]
The Three-Year Plan explicitly states that the enhancement of public information assets is a strategic objective for the Public Administration to effectively address the new challenges of the data economy also to provide policy makers with data-driven tools to be used in decision-making processes.
In this context, a National Digital Data Platform (PDND - Piattaforma Digitale Nazionale Dati) is established by the art. 50-ter of the mentioned Digital Administration Code that will enable public administrations to share its own data through APIs also with the aim to develop data-driven policies. The Plan includes specific actions for public administrations for the implementation of PDND.";These measures should promote concepts such as data-driven government, policy-making and decision-making.;;;;15

Furthermore, the Legislative Decree No. 36/2006 (amended by the Legislative Decree No. 200/2021 transposing the Directive (UE) 2019/1024) ensures the application of the principle that documents and data shall be re-usable for commercial or non-commercial purposes.
The Three-Year Plan for ICT in the PA 2022-2024 includes specific actions for smart communities related to specific project, such as the Smarter Italy project which intends to experiment with new technological solutions, alongside mechanisms of open innovation and smart procurement for the territories. Smarter Italy will initially operate on three lines: Smart mobility, Cultural heritage and Wellbeing, to gradually extend the digitization processes to the environment, infrastructures and training. The reuse of open data in this context is crucial.

Finally, the 2025 Strategy for Technological Innovation and digitisation of the Country includes 20 objectives among which ""Data for the Cities of the Future"" aimed at reusing data created by the operators fullfilling public services also by private sector to develop new services, new entrepreneurial activities, new innovative solutions (see https://assets.innovazione.gov.it/1610546390-midbook2025.pdf).";These measures could promote concepts such as smart cities and/or regions, but also new business development (in particular Small - and Medium-sized Enterprises), entrepreneurship etc.;;;;15

The Agency for Digital Italy (AgID) is in charge of the execution of legislation provisions for open data, the implementation of the Open Data Directive according to the national open government policies. The Agency manages the national open data portal and the national catalogue for spatial data, defines national guidelines about the information of the public sector, defines the national metadata profiles. 

The Department for Digital Transformation is the support structure for the Minister for Technological Innovation and Digital Transition for the promotion and coordination of the Government's actions aimed at defining a unitary strategy in the field of digital transformation and modernization of the country through digital technologies.
The Department is in charge, inter alia, of the implementation of the APIs catalogue (and the linked National Digital Data Platform) and the repository of ontologies, schemas and controlled vocabularies for the semantic interoperability.

AgID and the Department for Digital Transformation jointly pursue the strategic objectives relating to the enhancement of the open data provided for in the Three-Year plan for ICT in the Public Administration.

The Open Government Partnership (OGP) is an international initiative that aims to obtain concrete commitments from governments in terms of promoting transparency, supporting civic participation, fighting corruption and spreading, within and outside the Public Administration, new technologies to support innovation.
The member countries, including Italy, have approved the Open Government Declaration, which commits them to undertake new initiatives in the field of open government. The OGP community is based on the inclusion and partecipation of various stakeholders; in Italy the OGP community includes 57 public administrations and 53 representatives from civil society.
One of the main themes that has always been the subject of attention is represented by the Open Data.

Other responsabilities lie with other public administrations, also at regional and local level.

At level of individual public administration, a relevant role in the organisation of offices and resources for the process of opening and reuse of data is played by the Office of the Digital Transition Manager (RTD) established by Article 17 of the CAD - Digital Administration Code, who is responsible for the transition to the digital operating mode and who reports directly to the political top management or, in its absence, to the administrative management of the administration. The digital transition manager (RTD) plays a role of reference of the political and/or administrative top management and is a transversal figure across the entire organisation in power to act on all the offices and areas of the administration, on the one hand, and as a point of contact with the Agency for Digital Italy and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, on the other, for issues related to the digital transformation of public administrations";;;;;30

In paragraph 5.1.1. - Roles and responsibilities -  state that to implement the process, it is first necessary to define clear internal data governance with the identification of roles and related responsibilities, and to integrate its steps both vertically, with respect to already established internal processes, and horizontally with respect to the needs of different administrations.
An essential role in the organization of offices and resources for the process of opening and reuse of data is played by the Office of the Digital Transition Manager (RTD) established by Article 17 of the CAD, who is responsible for the transition to the digital mode of operation and who reports directly to the political leadership body or, in its absence, to the administrative body of the public administration. Circular No. 3 of October 1, 2018, of the Minister of Public Administration, in order to ensure the full operability of the Office of the RTD, recommends that in addition to the tasks expressly provided for, the act of assignment or appointment should also provide the power, among other things, to establish thematic groups for individual activities and/or fulfillments such as the process of opening and publishing data. In case this power is not assigned to the RTD, the establishment of the ""thematic"" group may be directly decided by the political or administrative top management. In any case, the RTD must still be involved given its role as a reference of the political and/or administrative top management and a transversal figure across the entire organization in power to act on all offices and areas of the entity, on the one hand, and as a point of contact with the Digital Italy Agency and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, on the other, for issues related to the digital transformation of public administrations, as also reiterated in the aforementioned Circular No. 3/2018. In the Guidelines, the Recommendation 4 states: it is recommended that the Digital Transition Manager (RTD) be tasked with setting up a working group (led by a manager and involving thematic managers from all offices in the administration that produce data), dedicated to the open data process and the implementation of these Guidelines within the institutional organization. However, the RTD must be involved throughout the aforementioned process.The open data working group is considered in the Guidelines as a structure for governing the open data process, deferring to the organizational autonomy of each entity the provision of any other structures and figures, as well as the identification of the tasks to be assigned to them.

This is achieved by making available, through an open-access portal, dashboards for browsing and self-service analysis of published data, of datasets in open RDF format and in the adoption of the OCDS (Open Contracting Data Standard) for their representation. The data present in the database are communicated to the Authority by the Single Procedure Managers (RUP) of the Contracting Stations and are published in their original form.

The Guidelines for the implementation of the Legislative Decree no. 36/2006 (as amended by the Legislative Decree no. 200/2021 transposing Open Data Directive) recommend PAs to define an own data publication plan, taking into account  some priorities on what data is to be open, i.e. HVD, dynamic data, data requested by users, data whose publication is mandatory by law (see https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/lg-open-data_v.1.0_1.pdf).";For data publication plans we refer to the existence of a specific workflow or internal data management process for publication of datasets. ;;;;20

The Agency for Digital Italy monitors, on a monthly basis, the increasing of open datasets on the national portal dati.gov.it. 
The monitoring takes place through the “Digital Transformation Enhancement”, a public dashboard that shows the state of the art of some projects of the Digital Growth Plan coordinated by the Agency. The dashboard publishes also the increase of number of administrations that publish open data (https://avanzamentodigitale.italia.it/it/progetto/open-data).
It is also possible to see the distribution of the published datasets throughout the DCAT-AP themes and the type of administration (national, regional, local ...). The data collected are public and available in open format in CSV and JSON format.

The Digital Administration Code assigns AGID the task of monitoring the implementation of the activities carried out by the administrations and assessing the results achieved with respect to the objectives of the Three-Year Plan for ICT in the PA. That monitoring, including the results for open data, is available here: https://monitoraggiopianotriennale.italia.it/ .

Furthermore, the Basket of key dataset is a tool used for monitoring the progress of data publication. Starting from the list defined as a plan, the data made available in open data are highlighted annually, and it is therefore possible to follow developments year by year, both for the national and the regional component (https://www.dati.gov.it/monitoraggio/paniere-dataset ).

;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;565
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

Full interoperability of public datasets is one of the main objectives pursued by the strategies for digital PA, including through the resources provided by the NRP. Specifically, the Plan aims to overcome vertical silos that are not interconnected through the implementation of the Digital National Data Platform (PDND) and the central catalog of APIs for accessing information held by public bodies. In this talk dedicated to the topic of data governance in the public sphere, we will delve into the challenges that await PAs as part of the path to implementing the data and interoperability measures envisaged by the NDPND, listening to the experience of some of the main administrations involved and the technology companies that are proposed as enablers of this important process. https://www.forumpa.it/manifestazioni/forum-pa-2022/dati-pubblici-e-interoperabilita-valorizzare-il-patrimonio-informativo-della-pa-per-abilitare-il-principio-once-only/

A Scuola di OpenCoesione (ASOC) is an innovative digital education pathway aimed at promoting and developing principles of active and aware citizenship in Italian schools through research activities and civic monitoring of European and national public funding, to answer the fundamental question, ""How is public money spent in the territories?"" ASOC makes it possible to introduce in schools the themes of civic monitoring, active citizenship, and participation, through an educational model structured by phases and moments of confrontation. A model that has become a point of reference in national and European cohesion policies, so much so that it has been successfully transferred and replicated in several EU countries, and recently put at the center of new experimentation also in the context of European Territorial Cooperation.

A regional equity profile to assess the impact of social inequalities on determinants and health outcomes in the population residing in Sicily Region (Southern Italy). Is a descriptive study aimed to define an equity profile in Sicily by using a rich list of indicators of structure of the resident population and of distribution of determinants and health outcome, derived from the integration of available information and scientific evidence at regional level with high local detail.
The equity profile collects available information on the health status of the population in Sicily, on the determinants, and on the use of health and social services. The characteristics of people or population groups have been explored and can produce inequalities on health which included individual and context socioeconomic status. Using available information sources and study results have explored the effects of the disadvantage on health in the region: mortality, morbidity, oncological incidence, reproductive health, and some of their determinants.
The study highlights how from the use of available information sources and the results of regional studies that have explored the effects of health disadvantage, several health outcomes (mortality, morbidity, cancer incidence, reproductive health and some of their determinants) have been characterized from an equity perspective.

The OpenDemanio portal is an online window on public real estate assets managed by the Agenzia del Demanio. Citizens, associations, local authorities and entrepreneurs can always have updated information on state assets and become promoters of investment projects, recovery and reuse.  
The sections that make up OpenDemanio are: Consistency and value: The data in the State Balance Sheet are updated annually, allowing you to know the territorial distribution of buildings and areas, their category (available assets, unavailable assets, artistic-historical state property) and their value. The data can also be consulted through a navigable map of Italy. Geolocation of State properties: In this section you can consult the map of the State buildings managed by the State Property Agency, displaying their location, also through Google StreetView. All buildings are equipped with an information sheet with the main features such as address, surface and category of belonging.  
OpenData: The data on the State's real estate assets are available in a transparent and open format, ready to be downloaded and used for research and in-depth analysis.  
Construction sites: This section of OpenDemanio identifies, locates and describes in detail the planned building interventions, above 100,000 euros, on the real estate assets managed by the Agenzia del Demanio, used by the state administrations. The maintenance operations relating to the latter type of use are managed within the ""Centralised maintenance system"" (Legislative Decree no. 98/2011, art. 12). By consulting the files of the individual sites you will discover the type of work (maintenance, restoration, better management of space), the stage of progress, the date scheduled for testing and funding available. The operations represented are managed directly by the Agenzia del Demanio or by the Provveditorato alle opere pubbliche (central purchasing bodies), against specific financing from the State budget. Rationalisation and Federal Building: The optimal management of the spaces used by the State Administrations, is one of the main activities carried out by the Agenzia del Demanio, which deals with identifying the best solutions available with the aim of containing costs and, in general, reducing public expenditure. This section includes and localises the most important operations for optimising space and reducing costs, the so-called rationalisations: thanks to information sheets, it is possible to learn about the buildings involved, the building interventions, the financing and the savings made. The most significant projects of Federal Building are also represented, a model that concentrates the public offices of the territory in a single location, offering a more efficient service to citizens. Regeneration and reuse: The valorisation of public buildings is one of the main activities carried out by the Agenzia del Demanio. The operations represented are the most important, capable of triggering processes of regeneration and development in the territories concerned. The various reuse projects include assets that are the protagonists of administrative, financial and urban planning paths aimed at maximising their economic, social and cultural value. Thanks to in-depth information sheets, it is possible to learn about the properties and subjects involved in the routes, the nature of the various initiatives and their progress.  
Value Country Lighthouses: The Fari project, promoted by Agenzia del Demanio e Difesa Servizi S.p.A., aims to create a network for the transformation of Italian coastal buildings into an opportunity for development for the territories that host them. In this section are presented the assets that are the protagonists of three calls for tenders, realized in 2015, 2016 and 2017 for the concession of some selected structures. Value Country Walks and Routes: The Valore Paese Cammini e Percorsi project is the new network project of the Agenzia del Demanio, promoted by MIBACT and MIT, which aims at the redevelopment and reuse of public buildings located along cycle-pedestrian routes and historical-religious routes. In this section are geolocalized the assets of the initiative, which with a recovery project, will become containers of services for walkers, pilgrims, cyclists and tourists.  
Section 110 cities: Modality of representation that makes it possible to distinguish graphically the different building interventions and rationalization and regeneration operations underway in the municipal boundaries of the provincial capitals.

Digital Skills Observatory: a series of dashboards that allow the reader to analyse the digital, no-digital and soft skill rate by occupational family and by individual occupation the associated competencies and elementary skills for each of them.
The skill rate analysis shows the percentage incidence of each skill rate component (digital, no-digital and soft) within each profession, both CEN and emerging. It is possible to compare skill rates overall (across all observed ICT professions), within the occupational family and within the individual profession.
The skill analysis allows to navigate - for each professional family - the 5 e-CF areas derived from the ICT business processes (PLAN - BUILD - RUN - ENABLE - MANAGE) and their distribution in each profession. Moving on to the in-depth analysis, the reader can further navigate the e-CF taxonomy (dimension 2) and, finally, the elementary skills associated with each e-CF category with the corresponding relevance. The relevance indicates the importance of the skill for the observed profession.

AIR BREAK is a project aimed at creating more awareness around the issue of air quality, as well as engaging citizens and local stakeholders in co-creating and experimenting with innovative solutions to improve the livability of neighborhoods and design clean commuting routes in the city.
The project also includes a simple and intuitive dashboard reusing the open data on air quality provided by the Regional Environmental Agency. The dashboard provides an immediate and concise estimate of the air pollution, updated hourly. The result is a page with no numbers or complicated, incomprehensible units of measurement (and thresholds) where citizens can understand ""the air you're in"" simply by ""seeing"" the amount of pollutant particles present.
https://airbreakferrara.net/che-aria-tira/

RESPONSE TO THE REVIEWER
Based on the data and information provided by the dashboard, six participatory workshops, or paths of open discussion, collaboration and public consultation, were initiated to decide together how to achieve the ambitious goals of improving air quality in the city. These are co-creation pathways to accompany project interventions and actions from conception (co-design) to implementation (co-implementation), to maintenance (co-management) and monitoring (co-monitoring). Some particularly successful solutions may eventually be the subject of future projects and replicated in other contexts (co-development).
In 2022 the views of the entire portal were almost 20000 whereas the visitors were almost 8000. In 2023, the views were 10246 and the visitors 4604.

Osservatori RRN Ismea: Competitiveness indicators - Socio-economic context
This section contains the indicators that describe the socio-economic context in which Italian agriculture is set.
In particular, the socio-economic context is described through dashboards on the territory, population, per capita GDP (at current value or purchasing power parity), employment rate (also distinguished in female and male), unemployment rate (overall and youth).
In the economy and employment dashboard, it is possible to consult the variables employment, labour productivity and added value referring to the macro-sectors of the economy: total economy, primary, secondary and tertiary sectors; there is also a dashboard dedicated to investment (gross fixed capital formation and the ratio of investment to added value), again broken down by macro-sectors. In these last two dashboards, in addition to the data in absolute value, those on the % composition of the value of the total economy by macro-sector are available.
Finally, information on household consumption expenditure is available in this section, both overall and for agri-food-related expenditure items: food and non-alcoholic beverages, alcoholic beverages, tobacco and narcotics, hotels and restaurants.

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe your approach.";yes;A generalized approach has been defined that provides for weekly harvesting of each federated catalogue (https://www.dati.gov.it/elenco-harvest-sources), except for specific requests for more frequent updating. Consequently, the update in the national portal is aligned with that one of the harvested local/thematic portal.;Please note that a regular updating of metadata refers here to an updating that is in line with the characteristics of the dataset in question. Different datasets have different requirements of currency.

Some actions and expected results in that Plan, indeed, concern the metadata quality:

R.A.2.2a - Increase the number of datasets with quality metadata compliant with European and national reference standards

To this end, the national portal makes available the list of data providers with the number of their datasets documented through metadata (see https://dati.gov.it/amministrazioni ) and the list of harvested catalogues with the number of datasets for each catalog (see https://dati.gov.it/elenco-harvest-source ). In addition, a validator has been implemented to allow data providers to know the quality of the metadata through compliance with mandatory and strongly recommended properties (such as contact point) in the DCAT-AP_IT profile. All this tools are used to discover any anomalies to be communicated to the competent administrations for a consequent improvement of metadata quality.
The dynamic Monitoring page in the data portal https://dati.gov.it/Monitoraggio/MonitoraggioDinamico shows the measures about the quality of metadata published in the open data portal on the basis of a weekly frequency. To this purpose some indicators have been identified in relation to which targeted and joint interventions are carried out with the individual administrations to improve the information available on the portal.
