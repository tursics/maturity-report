Using recent literature and case studies, this study reviews the typical areas of research on open government data and suggests research questions that can not only advance the field of open government data reuse, but also guide domestic researchers towards successful international adoption. http://unipub.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/3631/1/VT_2018-0708p32.pdf

Mapping domestic freedom of information practices and improving their effectiveness (KÖFOP-2.2.6-VEKOP-18-2019-00001) conducted by National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information. The presented project will support in particular the exploration of the situation and mapping of practices in the field of information publishing in Hungary by carrying out 4 pieces of targeted group specific analytical research. https://www.naih.hu/kofop-2-2-6-vekop-18-2019-00001/altalanos-tajekoztato

These studies are assessing the impact of open data used in the government workflow while imphasing the need and advances of open government data. The impact and mesurement of impact is strongly expressed in the study called Mapping domestic freedom of information practices and improving their effectiveness (KÖFOP-2.2.6-VEKOP-18-2019-00001). The advances of open government data are highly explicit in the study called 'Research Challenges of Open Government Data' written by Csaba Csáki and Andrea Kő.";;;;;25

Response to Reviewer 2:

The National Data Asset Management Agency also receives inquiries from organizations seeking assistance in utilizing and recycling open data for the development of research topics or decision-making processes. Based on open data, the National Data Asset Management Agency conducts analyses for both market players and government entities, contributing to resource allocation or investment decisions. A concrete example is the preparation of higher education data analysis, which serves as a basis for government planning regarding higher education financing. Another example is a university collaboration, where the National Data Asset Management Agency assisted in supporting research related to diseases.";"The governmental impact is hereby defined as the beneficial effect of the use of open data on three specific challenges faced by the government/public administrations: 1) Being efficient and effective in delivering public services; 2) Being transparent and accountable in their actions; 3) Improving their capacity to make decisions and policies.";Are there any official posts/press releases/news pieces that mention the content of your answer?

For this question, we are interested in information that describes the impact of open data in your country, such as the results of research, impact assessments, etc. Specific examples of reuse are suitable for the questions below.;;20

For justification:

In particular, the examples listed above have had an impact on administrative consultations and on reducing procedural time and costs, but many more examples can be given. They include:  

1. MEPÁR: https://mepar.mvh.allamkincstar.gov.hu/#/ - efficient allocation of EU agriculture funds 
2. Land Monitoring Information System: https://fir.gov.hu/ - public access to land monitoring data

42;"Is the use of open data in your country having an impact on transparency and accountability of public administrations?

For justification:
* If yes, please explain how and what kind of impact is created on the topic and provide examples of maximum 3 recent open data reuse cases in the form of research or application, whether developed by government or by civil society.";yes;"As we mentioned last year, there is a slight difference in approaches here. In Hungarian law open data means the “classic” transparency regime where the operation of the public bodies must be transparent, and all data related to this must be freely accessible. Hungary made large efforts in this field. We have one of the strongest Freedom of Information Act in the EU. The law obliges public bodies to publish certain information on themselves on their websites in a certain structure. In this regard, yes, open data made a huge impact on transparency, since a lot of information is available freely on internet on the operation of the public sector. PSI re-use, however, is a different topic, also different in legal terms. Freedom of information does not cover accessibility of public databases or datasets. A different law, a different regime is applied for PSI re-use. When we are speaking about data policy, this focuses mainly and almost exclusively for re-use related questions and has no direct effect of “classic” transparency or FOI issues. Therefore while there can be an indirect link between FOI and re-use, FOI has a constitutional, re-use has a socio-economical nature meaning that one can not direct affect the other.  

The following exemples promote the transparency and accountability of public administration: 

1. https://kormany.hu/  - FOI public data at central public administraion level published, like asset declarations or details of contracts 
2. Electronic Procurement System:  https://ekr.gov.hu/portal/kezdolap - public procurment data available  
3. Central Information Public Data Register gives information on the transparent use of public funds. https://kif.gov.hu/";;;Indeed, open data in itself is a way to be transparent. However, this question is interested in examples of re-users taking the open data and creating services/ applications/ solutions/ research/ etc that have an impact on the transparency of public administrations. Do you know of such examples of reuse cases? For open data to have an impact it must be used for a new purpose.;;15

An example regarding the impact created by open data in the Hungarian education system is the MTA SZTAKI KOPI Plagiarism Search Portal, which has been used free of charge by Hungarian higher education institutions for more than a decade to check the authenticity of papers and theses written by students. The essence of KOPI is that teachers can easily compare the written works of students with the text of assignments uploaded into the system, as well as with the content of other open databases and internet publications. At some universities, the results of KOPI plagiarism screening must be attached to the thesis. In case the measure of textual similarity with another piece of writing is over 10% the thesis will be rejected. (https://kopi.sztaki.hu/)

The Vocational training 4.0 strategy. Link: https://www.nive.hu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1024&Itemid=166 
The long-term plan is primarily based on the creation of an attractive learning environment and infrastructure, the provision of career opportunities and the professional work of instructors with up-to-date knowledge. It introduces the concept of the technical school, which is a 5-year training course that becomes the entrance hall of higher engineering education, and also announces a broad scholarship program for all students studying vocational education. Vocational training 4.0 lays the foundation for the possibility of creating sectoral training centers and also opens the door to the use of digital teaching materials to a large extent.";"The economic impact is hereby defined as the beneficial effect of the use of open data on three indicators of economic growth:

In section 4.3 `DCAT-AP Compliance`, the focus is on DCAT-AP exclusively. We are aware that many of the respondents may be compliant with other EU standards, such as INSPIRE. For the purpose of this assessment, only DCAT-AP and its country-specific profiles are relevant.

106;"Is there a pre-defined approach to ensure that metadata is kept up-to-date?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe your approach.";yes;We use the UIPath RPA tool to monitor the up-to-date status of our datasets on the Portal. We correct the metadat with the help of data managers if they are no longer up-to-date.;Please note that a regular updating of metadata refers here to an updating that is in line with the characteristics of the dataset in question. Different datasets have different requirements of currency. For example, a gazetteer of city streets only changes when new buildings and roads are built, or street names are changed, whereas the data on current weather conditions may be updated in quasi-real time.;;;;20

(for example, complete time series whether available for download or through an API);few datasets;N/A;This applies both to individual datasets that change in time and to archives of the same dataset, e.g. one every year, every month etc. Administrative geography is an example of data that changes regularly. When new houses are built, new postcodes may be created, and the areas referred by pre-existing postcodes may change. Making available previous versions of a postcode reference file enables the reuser to correctly interpret the meaning of a postcode vs the relevant time context.;;;;5
