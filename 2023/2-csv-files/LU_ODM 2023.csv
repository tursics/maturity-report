file formats, standards, automation of data publication;
decision support for licensing;
data protection considerations.
Promote the publication of higher quality and easier to use Open data.
Collaborate with the Luxembourg government's interoperability programme to encourage the publication of data in standard and interoperable formats.
Collaborate with the Luxembourg government's AI4Gov programme to foster the availability of open datasets that can be used for AI.
Collaborate with the ecosystem established under the Data Governance Act (re-use of certain categories of protected data held by public sector bodies).
Organise events:
Collaborative hackathons on a given theme;
Training for public sector employees;
Awareness-raising events.
Improve the quality and currency of metadata through awareness campaigns and audit procedures. Quality metadata allows data to be found more easily by users of the Open data Portal.

""Real-time data:
promote and increase the visibility of real-time datasets and reuses on the portal;
identify strategic real-time data that has not yet been published and support its implementation and publication;
organise an event to raise awareness of real-time data: added value for end-users, success stories, links to the Internet of Things, technical architectures, interoperability and standards.""";Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data.

With regard to the Open data law https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2021/11/29/a836/jo  and the Freedom of Information law https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2018/09/14/a883/jo, the national open data team assists data owners to publish (more) data by providing technical and legal assistance, while focussing on data quality considerations, interoperability issues, legal constraints and licensing as well as possible automation of data publication.
In this context the open data team closely collaborates with the Luxembourg government's interoperability programme and the governmental AI4Gov programme to foster the availability of open datasets that can be used for AI. Both programmes consist of yearly call for projects at the level of government administration and services, where data and opendata should be an important aspect.
An important aspect is the consistent professional training for public sector employees, to help the be more aware of the opendata topics and become an active part in the open data ecosystem.

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures that you have adopted or plan to adopt to cope with these challenges. 
* If no, please specifiy what is hampering finding a strategic approach to solve these challenges.";yes;"Challenge a is taken into account by a series of programs launched and financed by the luxembourgish ministry of digitalisation. For instance the ""NIF4Gov"" initiative which aims at making Government organisations more interoperable at every level (https://digital.gouvernement.lu/fr/dossiers/2019/NIF-2019.html) and where the opening up of data is one important element. In the same scope, there are workshops with government experts and the civil society (example https://digital.gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites/article/2023/15-03-hc-atelier1.html) to share knowledge,experience and ideas about these topics with the intention to improve the current situation.
In order to address the problem b, we go on with our permanent sensibilisation and education efforts. The Prime Minister's letter (https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/lettre-circulaire-aux-departements-ministeriels-administrations-et-services-de-letat-donnees-ouvertes/) has helped bringing the open data legislation and its obligations in the focus of decision makers, and it contains measures to help with the  organisational aspects mentioned in point c";;;;;10

This assistance now goes far beyond the level provided in the past, as we offer hands-on help with the automatisation of the harvesting/publishing processes. One example is the series of datasets concerning the municipalities' land use plans, published by the ministry of internal affairs https://data.public.lu/fr/organizations/ministere-de-linterieur/";E.g. a task force/agency that is in charge of promoting and assisting the data publication process at national and/or regional and local levels (where applicable).;;;;15

Actually, we are preparing a project to implement a national central HVD non-INSPIRE-data platform, destined to welcome all the HVD-relevant non-geodata in a central data warehouse, from where the data will be made available via an API and via bulk download. Actually we are waiting for detailed HVD data lists by the concerned actors, and have started a technical analysis of this data to fathom what technical solution should be considered. In this project for example we are discussing in detail about the real-time meteorological data.";Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time).;;;;10
25c;"Are there activities to assist geo-spatial data holders in their publication process?

For justification:
* If yes, please provide some examples of such activities.";yes;"The first important step to trigger a strong general availability of national public sector geodata on the opendata portal, has been the decision about the workflow that has to be followed by any organisation that wants to use the geoportal infrastructure : any geodata has to be published as opendata under an open licence on the portal, before this data is retrieved from the opendata infrastructure to be inserted and processed in the geoportal backend, and made available in the map tools as well as in specialised tools. 
Secondly the geoportal team consequently maintains a geodata provider network and a corresponding technical infrastructure, which means that every geodata issue is solved professionally and in a collaborative way to make sure the geodata holders can provide their data as well as improve their own use of this data.
A third important aspect is the principle of centralisation : for all INSPIRE geodata, we have implemented a central technical backend, which comprises inve ntories, complex ETL scripts for all identified relevant data, a central database and a central API/webservice/download service/view service infrastructure. As already described before, we also plan to add a similar infrastructure for all non geodata HVD data.";Geo-spatial data is data that contains information on properties that are linked to a position on earth.;;;;10

;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;445
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the key points of this methodology.";yes;"The use of the open data portal and of its data sets is monitored in detail, which allows to gain insights about re-use cases and their impact. In the portal, the internal statistic dashboard which renders key information about every dataset, is a good way to track the popularity of datasets, from the perspective of the data producers.
We keep an eye on the exchanges between data users and providers in the corresponding portal sections, to deduce possibly interesting re-use cases, and - as far as possible with the available means - we try to know more in order  to properly document the re-use to evaluate it's impact as well as to use it as an example to trigger further visibility for open data.
A particular case are API's where it is possible to require the use of a personal key, which obliges re-users to  be identified and the data providers to get detailed information about the uses. This is also the case of the geoportal API, which is used a lot at the national level, or the  public transport API for example.

- there is a rising awareness of the problems of inaccessible documents, above all PDF documents (see f.e. this analysis https://accessibilite.public.lu/fr/news/2023-04-28-des-pdf-majoritairement-inaccessibles.html) and already a visible improvement of the situation (see image 2 in the article f.e.)
Another topic is the employment / unemployment topic : although at the current state it is hard to say whether the measures already have a positive impact, there is no doubt that the availability of statistical data (f.e. https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/chiffres-cles-de-ladem/ or https://data.public.lu/fr/organizations/institut-national-de-la-statistique-et-des-etudes-economiques-du-grand-duche-de-luxembourg/) as well as detailed analysis like in the above mentioned report (https://statistiques.public.lu/fr/publications/series/analyses/2021/analyses-05-21.html) is leading to  more precise concepts and strategies designed to improve the situation for the endangered minorities. This means on the one hand, that there is more willingness to provide high quality actual digital data, and on the other hand increasing interest in digital processes designed to use this data to improve the processes. Here for example in the work program of the national employment agency ADEM, one can find a strategic goal to digitize their processes (objective 8 p 22 https://adem.public.lu/dam-assets/fr/publications/adem/strategie-adem-2025.pdf), to better take into account the information available about the clients who are looking for a job.

The open data strategy https://data.public.lu/fr/strategy/ contains some points that are  important with regard to the central position of the portal and its sustainability:

National Data Portal: Central platform - decentralised data
As part of this strategy, datasets are to be uploaded by data producers to the national Open data portal data.public.lu, where the aggregation of all proposed data facilitates the search for relevant data. To manage the decentralisation of data, the national portal syndicates the content available on other portals (e.g. geoportal, INSPIRE portal, statistical portal, ...).
The portal allows data producers and portal operators to interact and exchange information about the data. Coordinated collaboration with other national data initiatives as well as with European and international data portals ensures that Luxembourg data are visible and usable in a wider context and can lead to added value contributions.";A strategy could be a brief document and/or action plan listing the activities planned to ensure the portal’s sustainability over time.;;;;30

126;"Do you use a model (such as the 5-Star Open Data or FAIR) to assess the quality of deployment of data in your country?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe.";yes;"We mention the 5 star model in our meetings with data providers and in our trainings for public sector agents about data, opendata, transparency etc. There we try to promote at least ** and *** level. We also explain the FAIR principles.
Internally at the portal level we have an own metadata quality rating system, that helps data providers to be aware of potential quality issues at a glance.";For more information, please visit: http://5stardata.info/en/ or https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/W3C04.pdf.;;;;15
127;"Do you conduct activities to promote and familiarise data providers with ways to ensure higher quality data (such as promoting the model referenced in the previous question)?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe.";yes;We mention the 5 star model in our meetings with data providers and in our trainings for public sector agents about data, opendata, transparency etc. There we try to promote at least ** and *** level. This topic has gained increased interest and visibility due to the national Network Interoperability Framework programme, proposed by Luxembourg's Ministry of digitalisation (https://digital.gouvernement.lu/en/dossiers/2019/NIF-2019.html).;;;;;30
128a;What percentage of datasets is made available under a standard open licence or an explicit custom open licence, in any data format including text documents? ;>90%;N/A;;;;;20
128b;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128a), what percentage of datasets is made available under a standard open licence or an explicit custom open licence, in a structured data format?;71-90%;N/A;"Refers to open data that is available on the web under an open licence, in a structured format (=machine-readable format that is proprietary, such as .xls; .xlsx). Please note that formats such as .pdf; .jpeg; .png, .doc(x) are not considered machine-readable formats and should hence not be counted towards this answer.";;;;20
128c;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128b), which part is also in an open and machine-readable format?;71-90%;N/A;Refers to open data that is published in an open (=non-proprietary) machine-readable format. A non-proprietary format is a format for which a user does not require a proprietary software package (such as Microsoft Office Excel) to explore. An example of an open format is the comma-separated values (CSV) format for tabular data.;;;;20
128d;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128c), what percentage of datasets also consistely use Uniform Resource Identifiers?;<10%;N/A;"Refers to open data whose comprising objects are accompanied by unique identifiers. An identifier may be the object’s name (e.g. city name ‘Luxembourg’, or ‘10717’ -- a Berlin postcode), or a word describing the object (‘population’; ‘gender’), or another arbitrary identifier such as ‘XYZ0’, an identifier that makes sense only in the context of that dataset. Choosing identifiers based on known standards should be the common practice though, to facilitate data integration and linked data.";;;;0
128e;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128d), what percentage of datasets also links to other renowned sources to provide additional context for the users, e.g. in a linked data fashion?;<10%;N/A;;;;;0
129;"Do you monitor the improvements in terms of quality of open data deployment?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe how.";yes;We use an internal monitoring dashboard to monitor the open data quality.;;;;;15
