1;ja;"Ja, es gibt ein Open-Data-Gesetz auf Bundesebene. Im Juli 2017 trat § 12a des E-Government-Gesetzes (EGovG) in Kraft (Erstes Open-Data-Gesetz), mit dem erstmals eine gesetzliche Grundlage für die verpflichtende Bereitstellung offener Verwaltungsdaten durch Bundesbehörden geschaffen wurde. Durch das im Juli 2021 in Kraft getretene Zweite Offene-Daten-Gesetz wurden die bestehenden Pflichten nach § 12a EGovG inhaltlich weiter angepasst und auf die gesamte Bundesverwaltung ausgeweitet.

Das ebenfalls am 23. Juli 2021 in Kraft getretene Datennutzungsgesetz (DNG) soll das Informationsweiterverwendungsgesetz (IWG) modernisieren und ersetzen. Um die Nutzbarkeit von Daten zu verbessern, müssen offene Daten in maschinenlesbaren Formaten verwendet werden. Darüber hinaus regt der DNG Open-Data-Initiativen über die Grenzen der Bundesverwaltung hinaus an und etabliert das Prinzip „Open by Default“ auch für die Nutzung von Daten durch Länder, Kommunen und öffentliche Unternehmen in den Bereichen Wasser-, Verkehrs- und Energieversorgung . Das DNG setzt außerdem die EU-Richtlinie 2019/1024 (Richtlinie über offene Daten und Informationen des öffentlichen Sektors) um, die 2019 neu gefasst wurde.

The Federal Government’s Open Data Strategy, adopted on 6 July 2021, provides a framework for action to improve the Federal Open Data Ecosystem. The Federal Government’s data strategy forms the overarching data policy framework for the Open Data Strategy. Over a period of five years, the Open Data Strategy covers three areas of action, with a total of 68 implementation measures taken by different federal ministries and authorities. The three strands of action include improving the provision of data and developing data infrastructures, increasing innovative, public-interest and responsible use of data, and promoting data literacy and a data culture to increase the quality and usability of data provided. The implementation of the Open Data Strategy is accompanied by continuous monitoring.";;;
3;ja;"The Open Data Strategy itself not: The Open Data Strategy is currently in its implementation phase (until 2025).

BUT: The data strategy of federal governance, from which the Open Data Strategy is directly derived (see also the answer to question 2), is currently being further developed. This follows a corresponding mandate from the coalition agreement of the current Federal Government. This includes also basic elements of open data implementation (e.g. calls for more open data to be provided by the federal administration; the implementation of the previous Open Data Strategy remains in place).
The planned update of the data strategy is currently being discussed and revised within the Federal Government. As a result, up-to-date information of the latest developments is not yet available but is expected to be submitted by autumn.

Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz)
For an example of an open data policy see: https://www.landesrecht.rlp.de/bsrp/document/jlr-TranspGRPrahmen 
The Rhineland-Palatinate State Transparency Act (LTranspG) came into force on January 1, 2016. It regulates access to “information”, this means official information and environmental information. The law provides for an application procedure according to which anyone can request access to information present from any so-called transparency-obligated body (this includes all Rhineland-Palatinate authorities, insofar as they carry out administrative activities). Furthermore, the law regulates that the information defined in a definite list in § 7 para. 1 and 2 LTranspG must be published proactively (officially, without having to submit an application) by the bodies subject to transparency obligations. The place of publication is an electronic platform, the so-called transparency platform, provided by the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate. In addition to the Transparency Act the government of Rhineland-Palatinate is planning on initiating an open data policy similar to the one at federal level  in order to ensure that even more government data is available to the public free of charge and in a standardized, machine-readable form. In this context, the adoption of an open data strategy is also envisaged.

- Annual Round Table Open Data (BMI) (page 27)
""We promote the intensification and perpetuation of exchanges between the Federal Government and the Länder, involving representatives of civil society from relevant stakeholder groups.""";;These are good activities to mention in other questions. However, this question is interested in whether there are measures that incentivise publication of citizen-generated data (which is when citizen collect and contribute their own data). Your answer is Q52 might be relevant here as well.;
6d;ja;With the legal obligation to place the metadata in the national metadata portal GovData (see § 12a(5) EGovG), these data are automatically made available or visible there due to the GovData interface with the European Data Portal.;;;
7;ja;"The re-use of Data is especially supported by increasing the quality of data, which eases its re-use.

Furthermore, the Federal German government funds the re-use of Open Data by the C opernicus Project amount of total funding to be handed in in later progress.

The data strategy and also the open data strategy of the government outline that the state should become the frontrunner / leader in the field of data usage and provision. This includes increasing the provision of open data; data literacy and using the data for policy making (data driven government). The potential of data is increasingly being used for more efficient and citizen-friendly service. On top the implementation and evaluation of political measures through the use of open data will be 
improved. See the statements of the government in the data strategy here: https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/975226/1693626/60b196d5861f71cdefb9e254f5382a62/2019-11-18-pdf-datenstrategie-data.pdf?download=1";;;

- A measure of the Open Data Strategy: the Competence Center Open Data (CCOD) at the Federal Office of Administration has developed a prototype of a ""theme catalogue"" of open data. (https://opendatabund.github.io/themenkataloge/)

Regarding the regional / communal level:
Due to consitutional restrictions in Germany owing to Germany's Federal structure (Bund on the national level and the 16 Länder), the national government cannot directly mandate the federal states (Länder) or communes/cities and their respective public bodies to maintain a data inventory. However, within the limits of the German constitution, the national government has issued a law that specifies which data that must be published as open data (§12a). 
This is due to constitutional restraints (verfassungsrechtliche Hürden) but incentives were used e.g. in programmes to support local and regional initiatives (Modellkommunen/ Model Municipalities BMI) as well as dialogue formats with all regions and local authorities.

3) The CCOD is offering so called ""Fachforen"" (specialized forums) for civil servants, addressing specific issues regarding the work with open data, e.g. data quality and licensing of open data. Fachforen are open to civil servants from all administrational and federal levels.

4) In order to improve digital skills within the federal administration a ""digital academy"" has been set up to teach general skills, including open data. The portal has been launched in 2022 and offers training episodes, inter alia for open data, see: https://www.digitalakademie.bund.de/SharedDocs/03_Episoden/Lernreise_04/33_Open_Data.html

5) There are thematic open data trainings including the online course ""OpenGeoEdu"" that is supported by the mFund (https://learn.opengeoedu.de/opendata) (see also the videos inside to learn more about open data) .

33;ja;"Ja, but there is no one-size-fits-all definition of the impact of open data in Germany (which would, due to the constitutional division between federal level (Bund) and regional level (Länder) as mentioned above, hardly be applicable to Germany): most public bodies and institutions dealing with open data have delineated what the impact of open data (can) entail from their perspective.
- For instance, the overall impact of open data is described in the Data Stategy (see here https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1845634/f073096a398e59573c7526feaadd43c4/datenstrategie-der-bundesregierung-download-bpa-data.pdf?download=1.
- The Open data Strategy also contains a broad definition of the objectives and impacts of open data (page 5, 6), see URL: https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1940386/1d269a2ad1b6346fcf60663bdea9c9f8/2021-07-07-open-data-strategie-data.pdf?download=1
- Open data is a key aspect of the mFUND funding program. Innovation projects are supported financially that make their project results and research data available as open data at the latest after the project has ended. BMVI's open data portal mCLOUD (https://mcloud.de/) is the primary repository for the publication of open data for mFUND projects. The scope of the planned open data provision already plays a decisive role in the assessment of the submitted project proposals.
- A number of federal agencies have implented Open Data in all data relevant processes and in their strategic orientation (change management), e.g. BAW, BSH, DWD.
- The study  ""Kommunales Open Government. Gebrauchsanleitung für eine Utopie"" published by the  Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community moreover presents several concrete expectations of positive impact thanks to open government data (URL: https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/veroeffentlichungen/themen/moderne-verwaltung/leitfaden-modellkommune-open-govt.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1) 
-  In the course of the Ministry's project ""Modellkomune Open Government"", eight impact dimensions of openness and nine expected impacts for public bodies were identified (see pp. 61 & p. 65, URL:  https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/veroeffentlichungen/themen/moderne-verwaltung/projektbericht-modellkommune-open-government.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2)
- The study ""Digitales Gold"" from Berlin's ""Technologiestiftung"" outlines concrete impacts in different fields of open data application (URL: https://www.technologiestiftung-berlin.de/fileadmin/Redaktion/PDFs/Bibliothek/Studien/2014/140201_Studie_Digitales_Gold_Open_Data.pdf)";;;
34;ja;"As impact is defined in different ways (see Q33 above), there are different methodologies used on the national, regional, local and project-level. 
- On the national level, the implementation and corresponding impact of the open data law is measured through an online questionnaire and writing of a bi-annual ""Fortschrittsbericht"" (Progress report). See the first one and also the results of the mearung here: https://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/141/1914140.pdf
*(the second report is currently being prepared).
- The State (Land) NRW has developed a through evaluation for its overall open government strategy, which includes measuring its open-data-goals and the associated impact (URL: 
https://www-open-nrw.prod-drupal.nrw.de/system/files/media/document/file/opennrwt1web.pdf) 
- The project ""Modellkomune Open Government"" published an accompanying guidebook that specifies ""expectations"" associated with openness and concrete steps to achieve them. These are at the same time the basis for impact evaluation (URL: https://open-government-kommunen.de/goto.php?target=file_425_download&client_id=civitalis) 
- the Open Data Impact Award of the Stifterverband suggests that ""impact"" of open data in research means that the data has successfully been implemented in another societal field (creating an added value for society, openly available for a large number of users) (URL: https://www.stifterverband.org/innosci/open-data-impact-award)

Finally: in its coalition agreement from 2021, the Federal Government stipulated the establishment of an independent data institute in Germany. One task of this institution will be in future to develop further methods.";;;

- there is funding and other activities to promote research data management with the goal to make this high quality data accessible through the FAIR-principles for the benefit of science, business and civil society.

- In the mFUND program there are a number of projects that emerge from civil society engagement. One example is the project miki (""mobil im Kiez"", https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/miki.html), that aims to develop solutions for the navigation and orientation of people with reduced mobility under participation of civil society engagement. In total there are 15 mFUND-projects under participation of civil society organizations that use open data and/ or create open data.

- OParl is an initiative to promote the openness of parliamentary information systems at municipal level in Germany, see: https://oparl.org/

- There are currently 34 so called ""OK Labs"" all over germany which operate under the leadership of Code for Germany. These Labs work with open data on a daily basis and create several projects, applications and use cases. See an overview of the labs here:

https://www.dcat-ap.de/ // R2: For an exact explanation, we would have to answer the question separately.

In short, there are two legally different approaches between the CC BY 4.0 licence and the German data licence. CC BY focuses on material property law, while the German variant classifies the licensing of (official) datasets as a dedicatioentfälltdministrative act. This results in a different legal assessment. In addition, there are aspects from the regulations in Germany regarding general terms and conditions (GTC) in the context of civil law.

So there is a subtle legal distinction behind the data licence - a ""German peculiarity"". :-)

Nevertheless, the necessity of a national licence is currently being discussed and possibly reassessed in future.";;"Out of interest, will you please describe the ""German perculiarities""";
