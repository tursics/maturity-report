Examples: The entities covered must ensure the publication of available documents and data, inventories of accessible documents and related metadata, as well as search possibilities, under the terms of the regime of access to administrative and environmental information and the reuse of administrative documents. The data.gov portal is the central catalog of open data in Portugal, with the function of aggregating, referencing, publishing and hosting open data from different bodies and sectors of Central, Regional and Local Public Administration, also functioning as an indexing portal, of content hosted on other open, sectoral or decentralized data portals or catalogs:
• The open data made available therein must maintain levels of updating and permanent quality, so that they can be reliably reused by other computer applications;
• If the entity producing the open data does not make them accessible from its own systems, it must make them available on the data.gov portal, and must also ensure that they are always updated there. The related metadata must always be made available in an updated form to the data.gov portal, in order to facilitate their search and location as open data, including in cases where the entity producing the open data makes them accessible from of own systems; etc.

Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic.

The ongoing project entitled ""Open Data - Impact Assessment Model Definition"" (URL: https://www.base.gov.pt/Base4/pt/detalhe/?type=contratos&id=9601046) has implemented systematic methods for collecting (re)use cases, incorporating best practices (while also accounting for the cautionary lessons) from reports such as ""Rethinking the Impact of Open Data,"" ""The Economic Impact of Open Data,"" and ""The Use Case Observatory Volume I"" available on data.europa.eu.
The systematic methods for gathering eligible entities for building use cases about the impact they create when (re)using open data are the following prioritization rules:
a) having ongoing or scheduled data platforms, explicit data policies, data quality control procedures, and/or a general knowledge of its platform users
b) the data platform is in the form of a website, data portal, or web application
c) entities can be classified as private, public (government) or academic institutions
d) entities can maintain regular and effective communication with the Administrative Modernization Agency, I.P. (AMA)
e) entities can underpin if their operational influence is in at least one of the following sectors: social, governmental, environmental or economic
f) entities can be classified into at least one of the following positions of the open data value chain: data reuser, data portal, data intermediary

In section 4.3 `DCAT-AP Compliance`, the focus is on DCAT-AP exclusively. We are aware that many of the respondents may be compliant with other EU standards, such as INSPIRE. For the purpose of this assessment, only DCAT-AP and its country-specific profiles are relevant.

106;"Is there a pre-defined approach to ensure that metadata is kept up-to-date?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe your approach.";yes;"The metadata is automatically generated by actions on the datasets, so they are always up to date.

[Response to reviewer] Further explanation: 
There are 3 main forms for dataset registry, the following 2 are an approach to keep up-to date the metada: via portal API, whera data and metada is updated; and Harvesting.
The manual approach registry should be used for non dynamic data, but such is not controlled by us.

Examples:
API
https://dados.gov.pt/pt/datasets/dataset-estrutura-de-missao-prr-contratualizacao/
Harvesting
https://dados.gov.pt/pt/datasets/justica-no-mapa/";Please note that a regular updating of metadata refers here to an updating that is in line with the characteristics of the dataset in question. Different datasets have different requirements of currency. For example, a gazetteer of city streets only changes when new buildings and roads are built, or street names are changed, whereas the data on current weather conditions may be updated in quasi-real time.;Please further explain these actions. ;;;20

109;Where applicable, to what degree does the published data cover the full period from when it was first published until today? (for example, complete time series whether available for download or through an API);the majority of datasets;N/A;This applies both to individual datasets that change in time and to archives of the same dataset, e.g. one every year, every month etc. Administrative geography is an example of data that changes regularly.

[Response to reviewer] Further explanation: 
In particular part of the HVD, namely those in the Geospatial, Earth Obs. and Meteorological categories, that are already following the INSPIRE directive, the interoperbility is already ensured in the international context. For the remaining type of datasets there is not yet a pre-defined approach to ensure that interoperability, and it relies only on the metadata quality.";"* The implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138, adopted in December 2022 and published in January 2023 by the European Commission, lays down a list of specific high-value datasets and the arrangements for their publication and re-use. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023R0138

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly explain how this monitoring takes place. 
* If applicable, please provide the URL to this monitoring mechanism.";yes;"In the administration area, the user can access the published datasets. For each dataset, there is a ""quality"" box. That box aims to help the user improve the quality of the (meta)data associated with that dataset. It gives an overview of what will be useful for contributors to find and reuse that data. Publishing a dataset involves filling in several fields. The system analyzes whether this filling was done correctly. From there comes information about the quality of the dataset - it can suggest a more accurate and detailed description, the use of more tags, or the attachment of resources in a more open and machine-readable format.
