# Open Data Maturity Report

The [Open Data Maturity Report](https://data.europa.eu/en/publications/open-data-maturity/2023) (2023) shows the current implementation status of open data across the EU. It is based on a survey of all member states. The result of the report is available as a PDF and all raw data has been published as Excel files. A website with a dashboard exists.

## Why this website then?

The PDF summarizes the results very well, but does not shed light on every detail in the participating states. The Excel files are super detailed, but not fun to research. The dashboard is very superficial and contains missing and incomplete translations.

That's why I built my own visualization of the Maturity Report. I valued the following features:

- Show all questions and all answers
- Show all information from all states on the same page
- Zoom in on a state's response
- Compare the answers from all states in a simple way
- Show only the states you want
- Translate all questions and answers (from Germany) into German
- Use a nice look and layout
- A simple search, even across all states
- All totals are recalculated (and no longer contain any errors)
- A graphical view of which question is worth how many points and if it was answered correctly
- Overview of all questions, whether you achieved full points, from all states, on one screen
- Sort the states according to the points achieved, both overall but also in the topic groups and at the individual question level
