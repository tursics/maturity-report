1;other;"The Programme of the Prime Minister Marin's Government 2019 aligned that the Government will add depth to the management of information policy (https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/marin/government-programme/best-public administration-in-the-world). Openness of public information is the overarching principle of information policy. The Government continued resolutely the earlier efforts to open up public information resources, and it drew up a quality criteria (https://www.stat.fi/org/tiedon-laatukehikko/index_en.html) that can facilitate the use of such resources.

Finland has transposed the Directive 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information (ODD) by amending the Act on Public Administration Information Management (906/2019) and with the Openness of Government Activities Act (621/1999 with amendments, https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990621) on the basis of the principle of openness contained in it.

The Openness of Government Activities Act (621/1999 with amendments, https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990621) provides for the general right to access any official document, including electronic records, in the public domain held by public authorities and private bodies that exercise public authority. Applicants are not required to provide reasons for their request or to verify their identity unless they are requesting personal or other confidential information. Restrictions apply to non-official documents, documents relating to foreign affairs, criminal investigations, police matters, information concerning military intelligence and the armed forces, as well as confidential business activities. According to the Government Programme 2019, the need to update the Openness of Government Activities Act to extend its application to data and information more broadly will be examined. The Ministry of Justice has set up a working group for 2021-2023 for the update of the Openness of Government Activities Act (https://oikeusministerio.fi/julkisuuslain-ajantasaistaminen).

There is a wider information policy report which covers a larger scale of different information policy aspects, including public, private and 3rd sectors. The Report on Ethical Information Policy in an Age of Artificial Intelligence was published on December 2018 (https://vm.fi/en/information-policy-report). It covers open data as a part of information policy and emphasizes equal access to data, while stressing the ethical development of artificial intelligence. The policy goals are fostering the progress of entire society by advancing the creation of new skills and capabilities, encour-aging innovations and innovativeness, and by improving our national competitiveness. Open data is mentioned as one of the strengths of Finland, with wide swathes of public sector data already open, and as one of the policy goals with advance access to data, transferability and compatibility of data across the Single Digital Market. Open data is also inferred as one of the enablers for de-veloping artificial intelligence based on open information and technologies, and as one of the future development potentials, with further open data policies and as part of the future strategy development.
The Act on Public Administration Information Management (906/2019, https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2019/en20190906.pdf) aims to ensure harmonised and high-quality management of data as well as secure processing of datasets of authorities to implement the principle of openness. It aims to enable secure and efficient exploitation of the datasets of authorities so that an authority may attend to its tasks and provide its services suc-cessfully and in a qualitative manner in compliance with good governance; and to promote the interoperability of information systems and information resources.

Since 2020 several parliament parties are worked in a free-form and non-political working group with an interest to the cross-party discussion on information policy topics. The Working Group of Information Policy Actors from all parliamentary parties, in short, 'the collaborative group on information policy' tackles topics of interest that come up for discussion both nationally and internationally (https://tietopolitiikka.fi/information-policy-working-group/).";;;;30
2;yes;"The Government Resolution on the Opening Up and Use of Public Data with its measures to implement seeks to improve the opportunities of all central government organisations to utilise data. It is hoped that the same objectives will also be picked up by the rest of public administration. (https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/164023/VN_2022_33.pdf) 
The resolution sets out the strategic objectives for information policy, divided into four themes:
1. Steering, coordination and cooperation
2. Strategy and action
3. Information management 
4. Enabling factors

The Open Government Strategy 2030 for Finland (https://avoinhallinto.fi/assets/files/2021/03/Open_Government_Strategy2030.pdf) creates another strategical framework for openness with its key elements of open government as reinforcing dialogue in society, promoting everyone’s right to understand and to get across; and having leadership and competence ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate. It also reminds Finland’s active role to promote open government on the international level. The strategy includes open data in its open government goal with progress measuring elements. 

The IV Finnish Open Government Action Plan 2019–2023 (https://avoinhallinto.fi/assets/files/2019/09/Avoin-hallinto_IV_toimintaohjelma_LOPULLINEN_240919.pdf, in Finnish and Swedish only) emphasises openness and inclusion in three different dimensions: openness as a shared value, a strong legal foundation to openness and the continuous development of openness. These themes encompassed the following commitments for the implementation phase: 1) lasting openness by pervading all government actions and development measures; 2) the implementation of the Open Government Strategy, 3) creation of a Transparency Register to offer citizens information on the parties that seek to influence decision making; and 4) commitment and measures on open data. The realisation of commitments are monitored and evaluated during the implementation and afterwards. A new V Finnish Open Government Action Plan 2023-2027 is currently being prepared (https://avoinhallinto.fi/v-toimintaohjelman-laadintaprosessin-taustamuistio/, in Finnish and Swedish only).";;;;30

(https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/164023/VN_2022_33.pdf) The Ministry of Finance's project ‘Opening Up and Using Public Data' facilitated processes and created strategic documents and recommendations as 2020–2022. The goal of the project was put into effect the aims described in the Government Programme by promoting wider and more effective use of public data throughout society and strengthens and concretizes these information policy and strategy goals (https://vm.fi/en/opening-up-and-using-public-data). The project enhanced use and share of public data in order to support the data holders and publishers as well as the large amount of other stakeholders with information packages, webinars and other activities. The project also co-operated with the National Data Portal team to support the Opendata.fi portal. 

The National Information Management Board (https://vm.fi/en/information-management-board) has given new recommendations. Links to the recommendations, in Finnish and Swedish only, are available at the end of the page https://vm.fi/tiedonhallintalautakunta. The recommendations are related data opening activities in various points of view and aims to support data holders with their information and data management issues.

The resolution is divided into four themes which are 1. Steering, coordination and cooperation,  2. Strategy and action, 3. Information management and 4. Enabling factors. Each theme describes certain strategic objectives which are divided into 16 main objectives and several sub-objectives that support it. The resolution contains objectives like “The organisation's strategy supports the using and opening up of information.”, “Data is used responsibly and steps are taken to prevent the dissemination of false information in society.” and “Data is interoperable and of high quality in accordance with national quality criteria.” A roadmap of measures to support the implementation of the objectives has been prepared for central government. The first version of the road map is included with the resolution. More detailed preparation, processing and other procedures relating to it will be agreed separately on the basis of the resolution.;;;;25
6a;yes;"The nation wide ‘The Opening Up and Using Public Data’ project coordinated by the Ministry of Finance of Finland developed several measures regarding open APIs, technical and semantic interoperability, as well as data quality in order to incentivise and support the publication of and access to real-time or dynamic data. The project created the API Principles to provide common instructions and recommendations for API development by adapting the JRC API Framework into Finnish public administration (https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/api4dt/news/api-framework-implemented-finland/; http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-952-367-915-3). The Act on Information Management in Public Administration (906/2019, https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/2019/en20190906.pdf) includes sections of the disclosure of datasets via a technical interface both to the authorities and to other than authorities (Sec. 22 & 24).

The existing Information Policy sets open APIs as a goal for the public sector, because open APIs are seen as the most future-proof way and as an incentive to avoid future maintenance when distributing high-quality always up-to-date and real-time data in a systematic, machine-readable format. New business models and new combinations of skills, from different fields and branches of public and private sector, enabled by the open APIs are seen as additional incentives. Open APIs are also seen as one of the key enablers for future growth.";;;;15

RESPONSE: National strategy concerning geo-spatial data includes three programmes and nice focus-points with different measures (see examples below).

Focus-point 1.1. Carbon-neutral society
Measure: The geo-spatial data industry identifies key players in terms of the carbon neutrality goal and begins cooperation with them to map customer needs and solve customer-specific problems.
Measure: Public organisations in cooperation with companies ensure high-quality and
accessible national geo-spatial data. It supports climate work, increases
the quality of top research and promotes the use of location-based methods
to achieve carbon neutrality goals.

Focus-point 1.2. Urbanisation
Measure: Together, the construction and geo-spatial data industries create and develop a digital twin covering the entire urban environment, which serves all industries throughout the life cycle.

Focus-point 2.1. Ensuring the competence
Measure: The education administration adds the basic information about geo-spatial data to the teaching programs. Students should get a sufficient understanding of the professions and training places offered by the geo-spatial industry.";;For completeness, kindly describe briefly the measures here;;15

In line with the objectives of Prime Minister Marin's Government Programme 2019, the efforts to open up public information resources have continued, and the Ministry of Finance and Statistics Finland have jointly drew up a quality criteria that can facilitate the use of such resources (https://www.stat.fi/org/tiedon-laatukehikko/index_en.html). A recommendation of the Information Management Board related to the quality criteria is currently being prepared (https://www.lausuntopalvelu.fi/FI/Proposal/Participation?proposalId=59eadc66-f50a-426a-abab-6808e777b6de, in Finnish only).

One of the aims of the Act on Public Administration Information Management (906/2019, https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2019/en20190906.pdf) is to enable secure and efficient exploitation of the datasets of authorities. Thus that, an authority may attend to its tasks and provide its services to public administration clients successfully and in a qualitative manner, in compliance with good governance.

The Ministry of Finance’s project ‘Opening Up and Using Public Data’ (2020-2022) promoted wider and more effective use of public data throughout society (https://vm.fi/en/opening-up-and-using-public-data). The project enhanced the use and share of public data in order to support the data holders and publishers. As a part of the project, the operational model for data sharing was created to make public sector data available more systematically either as open data or for wider use than at present, primarily via APIs (https://www.avoindata.fi/en/operating-model). The operating model supports data sharing by describing the stages, obligations and recommendations that public administration actors should take account when planning any data opening actions. Also the resolution of the strategic aims on using and opening up data to make the policy goals more concrete and enhance their implementation were adopted at the government session on 17 March 2022 (https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/164023/VN_2022_33.pdf).";;;;15

9a;yes;"The mandate to describe and maintain a data inventory is a part of statutory task of maintaining the Information Management Model for the most of the public sector bodies since 2021. According to the Act on Information Management in Public Administration (906/2019, https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/2019/en20190906.pdf), each of public sector information management entity shall maintain an information management model, which defines and describes the information management in its operating environment. The Information Management Model is maintained to design and implement the management of services, consideration, and datasets; to implement the rights and restrictions relating to access to information; to decrease multiple collection of information; to implement the interoperability of information systems and information pools; and to maintain information security. The Ministry of Finance of Finland maintains the Public Sector Information Management Map, which describes the data resources to utilise and the procedures for accessing data from the data resources (https://www.exploreadministration.fi/information-management-map-of-public-administration/).

The Act on the Openness of Government Activities (621/1999, https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990621) mandates the catalogues listing the data inventories to be published as open data. These catalogues give an indication on what each data or information repository holds, for example the City of Vantaa's catalogues of information systems (https://hri.fi/data/fi/dataset/vantaan-kaupungin-tietojarjestelmaluettelo). The dataset provides a list of all information systems in use at the city and information on system ownership, technical responsibility and a brief description of each information system.

The GDPR has also necessitated that all data providers review their data storages and identify personal data for the GDPR coverage, and as part of this review, build the necessary metadata to be able to properly catalogue and identify the data for each data repository.

To make the descriptive metadata of these models and lists better semantically interoperable, data holders and model maintainers, from both public and private sector, can utilise the Interoperability Platform (https://dvv.fi/en/interoperability-platform), a workbench and a set of tools, for defining and describing interoperable data content. The platform consists of glossaries, code sets and data models needed for data flows and in other areas of information management. The tools and the existing data specifications are available free of charge for terminology work, management of code sets, and data modelling. Data content producers are responsible for their own data specifications and their quality, and for keeping them up to date.";;;;15

There is members from governmental organisations and agencies, municipalities as well as from academia involved to the group. So far, two webinars have been held with the group, and the next one has been scheduled for June 2023. More information about the implementation project is available https://vm.fi/hanke?tunnus=VM053:00/2020. The national open data portal, Opendata.fi, has an initial understanding of nationally prioritised high value datasets, that enable for example software developers to scale their service on a European level. The national portal has also an understanding of the high value categories and initial data sets formed with the key regional stakeholders, such as, the Helsinki Region Infoshare HRI (https://hri.fi/en_gb/) and the 6 largest cities of Finland. 

Discussion related to the high-value open data in Finland is ongoing in different formats and environments, for example in the Finnish Open Data Ecosystem Facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/102381085627). The transposition of the Open Data Directive's implementation acts will provide further guidelines. The project on Opening Up and Using Public Data has also created a model to support data prioritisation process (BRC Assessment Tool https://www.avoindata.fi/en/operating-model). At the local level, there is social media groups for local discussion, for example in the Jyväskylä region (https://www.facebook.com/groups/opendatajkl), Pori (https://www.facebook.com/groups/opendatapori), Tampere (https://www.facebook.com/groups/opendatatre) and Turku (https://www.facebook.com/groups/opendatatku).

On local level, for example the Helsinki Region Infoshare HRI carries out regular consultations with data providers. The measures are planned as a part of the annual working programme, see for example year 2022 Chapter 2.7. pages 20-24, https://www.hel.fi/static/hel2/tietokeskus/data/dokumentit/HRI_toiminta_ja_taloussuunnitelma_2022.pdf, in Finnish only. It is possible to suggest open data needs to the HRI (https://hri.fi/en_gb/new-data-request/) and ask them to open data that the development community considers valuable. The HRI also regularly asks for suggestions to open useful data in developer meetings, annual user survey and in their social media channels.

The Act on Information Management in Public Administration (906/2019, https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/2019/en20190906.pdf) creates a common governance model and instruments to steer, encourage and support public administration's information management including open data. A specific open data governance model is not included in the act. Thus, open data is considered to be an integrated part of any organisation’s or information management entity’s work flow or data resources. Some of the solutions have been described in the operational model of data sharing https://www.avoindata.fi/en/operating-model.

As part of the continuity of the implementation of the Ministry of Finance's 'Opening up and using public data' project, Statistics Finland maintains a cooperation network related to data quality. The network brings together parties working with data quality, shares and increases competence, and develops the quality of data and its descriptions together (https://www.stat.fi/org/tiedon-laatukehikko/tiedon-laadun-yhteistyoverkosto.html). In addition, the Digital and Population Data Services Agency maintains a cooperation network related to API development. The network will meet approximately eight times in 2023 (https://www.avoindata.fi/fi/rajapintaperiaatteet/verkosto). 

The national open data portal Opendata.fi does not have a formal body of governance set up. Its governance and budgeting is arranged as a part of the Digital and Population Data Services Agency’s governance processes and budgeting. The portal team regularly consults and shares development roadmaps, synchronizes development, and agrees mutual approaches on for example harvesting, data archiving and expiration, data sets of high value, with key stakeholders like Helsinki Region Infoshare HRI.fi and the six largest cities of Finland. These quarterly talks are cooperative rather than directive in their nature. Opendata.fi and hri.fi portals also receives community feedback on portal development plans through hackathons and events.
Helsinki Region Infoshare service and Lounaistieto service organize events which gather different open data stakeholders to participate (https://hri.fi/fi/ohjeet/datan-hyodyntajalle/kehittajayhteistyo/).

A specific open data governance model is not included in the act. Thus, open data is considered to be an integrated part of any organisation’s or information management entity’s work flow or data resources. 

Governance of publishing data is out of the act’s scope and publishing processes are regulated, among other statutes, by the Openness of Government Activities Act (621/1999 with amendments, https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990621). It provides for the general right to access any official document, including electronic records, in the public domain held by public authorities and private bodies that exercise public authority. Restrictions apply to non-official documents, documents relating to foreign affairs, criminal investigations, police matters, information concerning military intelligence and the armed forces, as well as confidential business activities.

The roles and tasks of self-governance takes place naturally on the various levels of public administration and public sector activities. When it comes to the municipalities, they enjoy wide autonomy secured by the law. One of the challenges of this approach is total 309 muncipalities with local governments, majority having a population of less than 20,000 inhabitants.

Open data sets of Finnish municipalities, e.g. infrastructure related data, have been searched from Russia and its partner countries. These security concerns threaten to reduce the enthusiasm of municipalities and other actors to open up information. Situation also increases general expectations for influencing legislative drafting, especially revision of the Directive establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the EU (INSPIRE).

At the moment, there is a really active phase going on in terms of EU legislation regarding digitization and data management. The amount of regulation and its difficult interpretation may cause challenges especially for small actors and possibly also affect the willingness and resources to open data.

40;Yes;"RESPONSE: Good point. In the evaluation of the state aid reform, the effects of the reform have been discussed from the point of view of transparency and utilization of information, but it is more of a qualitative assessment than a quantitative study. 

Example: ""From the point of view of citizens, the clear positive effect of the reform of state aid activities can be considered to be that increasing the openness and transparency of information about state aid promotes the realization of the openness of administration and the principle of publicity included in fundamental rights. In particular, increasing the transparency of information about state aid improves the possibilities of monitoring the use of public power and funds. Increasing transparency also improves citizens' participation rights.""

50;yes;"The Finnish Meteorological Institute provides most of its datasets open, free of change, in WMS format and some in Amazon AWS S3 format through the FMI Open Data Services since 2013. More information on the FMI website: https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data. 

An impact study focusing on data usage in 2018 and a user survey on the FMI Open Data Services was conducted in 2019 which proved the value of open data information for business, public sector, and citizens. According to the study, FMI open data has a significant impact on business. 14% of the private company respondents said that FMI open data have generated new business during last 3 years (N = 389; 14 % of 389 = 54 companies). 

User survey and impact study results

Use of open meteorological data through the FMI Open Data Services:
- Most users use interpolated timeseries
- Large datasets are disseminated via AWS and it’s important for heavy users
- Timeseries API is crucial
- Summer is the busiest time of the year (three times more data requests)
- Removing of API-key increased significantly data requests
- Guidelines and manuals were used by approx. 60% of the users
- 25% of respondents use FMI open data with other open data  
- Four top datasets cover over 3/4 of requests:
o Station specific weather observations
o Weather forecast model HIRLAM (production was terminated in late 2022)
o Lightning strikes
o Weather radar images

Users of the FMI Open Data Services:
- Over 60% of users couldn’t be recognized. However, 80% of recognized users were companies and only 6% from public sector. 
- The companies requested mostly weather forecasts and surface observations and public sector used a lot of road weather observations

FMI Open Data Services is used for example in:
- teaching students in the elementary and high school
- water supply and waste management services, especially for forecasting waste-water flow 
- displaying real-time and historical marine weather data as background information in our services for the users
- estimating solar power production

Access to FMI Open Data Services

Access to FMI open datasets through the web interfaces:
• Discovery Service (a.k.a. Catalog service) providing metadata about the available data sets and services, implemented using the OGC Catalog Service for Web (CSW),
• View Services giving a visual preview of the available data sets, implemented using OGC Web Map Service (WMS), and
• Download Services providing a continuous online access to the most up-to-date data, implemented using OGC Web Feature Service (WFS).

The data is widely used anf the impact is already quite deep within the planning and conservating processes. Resent user cases, for example: Forest fires in Fennoscandia under changing climate and forest cover (IBA-ForestFires) https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/iba-forest-fires;

The National Land Survey's laser scanning project (2020-2025) produces more detailed open data for predicting and managing flood risks. The project is still in progress, but the impacts and benefits have been assessed in the Excel file (Taloudelliset hyödyt -tab, point 7) attached to the response.

RESPONSE: The impacts have been evaluated from the point of view of data utilisation. For example, regional administration authorities and municipalities can use new laser scanning data to combine flood risk data with land use data (buildings, construction plans), which in the future will increase people's safety and reduce material damage.

Additional information: We have also the CO2data.fi online service that provides objective data on the climate impact of construction products used in Finland, such as carbon footprint and handprint, material efficiency and recyclability. The data harmonises the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of buildings and facilitates the design of a low-carbon building. The database is based on public information and open data, and can be used by land use or building designers, construction companies etc. Link: https://ym.fi/-/rakentamisen-paastoja-voidaan-nyt-vertailla-uusi-paastotietokanta-luo-perustan-vahahiilisen-rakentamisen-saadosohjaukselle?languageId=en_US";;Please clarify whether the impacts of the National Land Survey's laser scanning project are reuse cases or whether this refers to the primacy benefits of the project.

Lounaistieto has succeeded in this task excellently through long-term work (https://turunkauppakamari.fi/news/lounaistieto-palkittiin-vuoden-ict-teko-tunnustuksella/).

RESPONSE: After review, our original answer is not suitable for this question. However, the utilisation of open data in the context of new innovations has increased, but this is more visible in business creation. There are more and more companies basing their business on open data, for example Vainu's (www.vainu.com) business idea is to collect open, public data and use it to form an accurate situational picture of companies. Handata Oy (www.handata.fi) serves the public sector in publishing purchase invoice data and managing by information of procurements, and maintains the country's most extensive database of public procurements and purchases. The sources of their data are municipalities, municipal associations and the avoindata.fi service and the financial data of municipalities published by Statistics Finland.

We also update our data model and the related validation tools annually to include new mandatory and recommended metadata fields if they assist in better medatada descriptions in the national context.";;;;15

124b;see answer box;"The reasons are the same in 2022 as in 2021: 
1 = Very old data sets that are published before DCAT-AP 1.1 are not necessarily compliant if they have not received any content updates. 
2 =  Some data owners provide minimum metadata descriptions only. We do not mandate filling in some of the recommended fields, or practically any of the  optional fields when submitting new data sets. 
3 =  For some harvested data sets (esp. geospatial data), the metadata available does not match the DCAT-AP metadata 100% at the time of writing.
We are in the process of finalizing our GeoDCAT-AP support, and are cooperating with select data publishers to assist them in ensuring that
the harvested metadata provides at least the mandatory and recommended metadata for GeoDCAT-AP compliance.
4 = A large number of data sets (esp. maps and other geospatial data) on the Finnish portal carry additional metadata that is not explicitly identified in the DCAT-AP specification. The majority of this data can be made GeoDCAT-AP compliant with focused cooperation between opendata.fi, Paikkatietohakemisto and the data publishers. Cooperation to eventually address this issue more completely has started between Paikkatietohakemisto and opendata.fi.";;;;15

126;yes;"Opendata.fi assesses the quality of the data according to the 5-star model. Based on discussions with the data openers at the time of answering, both data publishers and open data re-users consider the model cumbersome and difficult and  thus a barrier for publication. A lot of typical open data re-users (e.g. regular citizens and reporters in media) use open data in very basic/proprietary formats, such as MS Excel. 

We are increasingly trying to apply the FAIR principles in assessing the data quality and related communications to the extent that is possible. Implementing the principles in the national portal is not clear cut, but we aim for higher adoption. 

Opendata.fi also considers it problematic that the data semantics in the 5-star model are not anchored with anything. The semantics do not, for example foster interoperability of data on national (Finnish) or European levels. The portal team’s experience has, however, shown that the best publishing approach is either three stars or five stars on the 5-Star model.";;;;15
127;yes;Opendata.fi communicates both the 5-star model and the FAIR principles in the portal’s technical framework and related documentation as well as  in the Data Owner’s guide. We have also taken up the model in the events and meetups with data providers systematically over the years.;;;;30
