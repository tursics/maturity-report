1;yes;"Spain has had a national open data policy since 2007. This open data policy has been evolving in accordance with the guidelines set by Europe. This policy is reflected in Law 37/2007

In addition to the aforementioned regulatory framework, Spain has a series of strategic documents that reinforce the open data policy for the 2020-2025 period. These documents include:

- The Digital Agenda for 2025, which contemplates the implementation of a National Artificial Intelligence Strategy that includes measures related to the availability of open data, which are essential for the correct operation and training of Artificial Intelligence systems.
- The Digitalization Plan for Public Administrations 2021-2025, which highlights the intention to evolve the model of access to public and private information to facilitate the development of high value-added services, based on the work developed by the Aporta Initiative.
- The IV Open Government Plan of Spain 2020-2024, which includes actions such as the improvement of real-time access to dynamic data through appropriate technical means and the promotion of data sets with high reuse value through their selection, the definition of common vocabularies and their publication.
Likewise, the Data Office, which assumes the governance policies and standards in data management and analysis that should govern the General State Administration, is working on a national data strategy and an update of the national open data strategy.

3;yes;"The national open data strategy has been updated in recent months. The document that establishes the guidelines that will guide the open data strategy in the coming years is in the process of final revision. The current Strategy is configured as an open document, so it can be subject to modification at any time depending on new needs and priorities that may arise in response to new challenges and opportunities for public administrations, leaving room for the opinion and needs of the existing open data community, and bearing in mind European values and priorities.

The main actions proposed to be deployed are listed here: https://datos.gob.es/sites/default/files/datosgobes/dimension1_2023_evidenciapregunta_3.png

In addition to the strategy, the national open data policy was updated in November 2021. A summary of the main modifications can be found in the following: The keys to the Law on the reuse of public sector information in Spain (https://datos.gob.es/es/blog/las-claves-de-la-ley-sobre-reutilizacion-de-la-informacion-del-sector-publico-en-espana).";;;;10
4;yes;"Taking into account the guidelines set by national policy in Spain, regional and local administrations have been developing specific open data policies and strategies that complement the work developed at the national level. The following are examples of recent cases corresponding to each of the three levels of administration:

o At the local level, the data strategy of the City Council of Valencia seeks a paradigm shift in the city in terms of the provision and management of open data and encourages the opening of quality public and private data and information. More info: https://www.administracionpublicadigital.es/proyectos/2022/07/valencia-presenta-su-nueva-estrategia-de-datos-abiertos

o At the regional level, in June 2022 the Generalitat Valenciana took decisive steps on the path of open government, which are based on an ambitious open data strategy to produce complete and effective transparency, to enable results-based management and accountability, and to generate a network of relationships with different segments of reusers that can give value to the data and contribute to social, economic, environmental and democratic development.

6a;yes;"The national open data policy, reflected in the recently amended Law 37/2007, in its Article 5.4, refers: ""The subjects referred to in Article 2 shall make available the dynamic data available to them for reuse immediately after collection, through appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) and, where appropriate, in the form of bulk download"". 

The policy as a whole, and this article in particular, is mandatory for the General State Administration, the Administrations of the Autonomous Communities and the Entities that make up the Local Administration, among other public bodies.
In turn, the Government of Spain is in the process of approving a Data Strategy in the General State Administration, which includes an axis 3 called ""Strengthening the generation and use of open data"" (see: https://datos.gob.es/sites/default/files/datosgobes/dimension1_evidenciapregunta_6a.png).  

This strategy states: ""The publication itself must be done considering the FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable), considering current and historical information, evidencing the dynamic nature of the data, publishing under simple open licensing conditions and guaranteeing certain service conditions"".";;;;15
6b;yes;"The Data Strategy in the General State Administration, which is in the process of approval, underlines the importance of publication and access to geospatial data through the following reference: ""The ubiquity and interdisciplinary function of geospatial data makes it particularly valuable as a base data on which to base other information, and its publication should be encouraged. Geoinformation and Earth observation data are essential in finding solutions to societal challenges such as climate change and environmental protection, sustainable supply of raw materials, energy transition, and internal and external security, thus enabling the foundations of a digital value creation chain to be laid.""

In addition, according to the new guidelines of the National Open Data Strategy, in the process of final approval, highlights:
.- the obligation that the high value datasets (HVDS) supplied from the General State Administration be accessible from the Platform of the via API (massive download), being made accessible with the appropriate levels of service, internally and externally, attending whenever possible to its geospatial component.";;;;15
6c;yes;"In the Data Strategy for the General State Administration, which is in the approval process, the importance of publication and access to geospatial data is emphasised through the following reference:

âCitizens, within âcitizen scienceâ initiatives, adopting a role as data donors, can contribute information that is very valuable in the preparation of the public sector data space, information to be included within the set of information accessible for public purposes, research and for its publication as open data. The data altruism policy must define the general interest objectives for which citizens would be willing to donate their data and create a platform that permits that altruism to be exercised. The policy should seek integration with the public sector data space and with distributed digital identity systems (âdigital walletâ).â";;;;15

Likewise, datos.gob.es should interact with the European data portal (data.europa.eu) by federating its data catalogs.""
As well, the national open data action plan refers to the National Catalogue as âthe single channel of communication with the European data portal, a space in which it is possible to locate data available for re-use from the various member countries and of a different nature (spatial, in real time, etc.).â
Likewise, it emphasizes the idea that thanks to the existence and compliance with European standards, it is possible to synchronize the data published by the Spanish administrations in the national Catalogue daily at data.europa.eu.

This publication must be made under service conditions that enable both access to the data within the Administration and access to the general public.  

The objective is to advance in the role of administrations as consumers of information generated from other agencies, as reflected in the internal document: Inventory of Information Reuse Data of February 2023. See here: https://datos.gob.es/sites/default/files/datosgobes/dimension1_2023_evidenciapregunta_9a.png

This data inventory is based on the following conviction: ""The action and communication of administrations can be more effective, more transparent and more sustainable if they are based on valid and solid data provided in real time at the time of decision making.  An intensive use of data allows to boost innovation in public sector actions, facilitating the contrast of ideas, promoting creativity and the maximum use of resources in the general framework of a modern, participative, open and useful public management to solve or improve social problems and challenges"".";;;;15

11a.6;Yes;"In Spain, there is a clear link between policies linked to transparency and the national open data strategy, the Aporta Initiative. 
Thus, and as referred to in the Data Strategy in the General State Administration:
âPublic administrations must be a driving force for an authentic open data culture, a culture aligned with the 2025 Digital Spain Plan and the I4th Open Government Plan of Spain 2020-2024. Collaboration between administrations and with the private sector and civil society is essential for completing the data value chain, encouraging the dynamic development of private initiative and civil society when creating new value products and services added based on the data. Making data available for re-use makes economic and social benefits possible, while also benefiting the organisation that offers the data, and ultimately helps to achieve the European objectives of promoting a fairer, more inclusive economy in line with the 2030 Agenda.â";;;0;
11b;Yes;".-> One of the recent general actions of Spain's open data policy that should be mentioned are the efforts being made to:
.- ensuring the definition, creation, storage, maintenance, access and use of data: data man-agement. 
.- ensuring the definition of a data strategy aligned with organizational strategies: data gov-ernance
.- ensuring that the data used are suitable for their intended use: data quality.
With these objectives in mind, three UNE normative documents have recently been devel-oped and published, i.e. experimental standards created in the Technical Standardization Committees (CTN) of the Spanish Standardization Association (UNE).
The three UNE specifications to be highlighted are: UNE 0077:2023 Data Governance, UNE 0078:2023 Data management and UNE 0079:2023 Data quality management.
The three standards are designed to be applied together, enabling the conception of a solid and harmonized reference framework that encourages the adoption of sustainable and ef-fective data practices.
See more: https://datos.gob.es/en/blog/une-specifications-government-management-and-data-quality

.-> Another specific action being developed in this sphere is the interconnection between data spaces and open data initiatives. Spain is very aware of the conclusions outlined in the report âData.europa.eu and the European common data spacesâ and is trying to mitigate the weaknesses identified within. These are the two main weaknesses being analysed:
.- Open data holders are not usually involved in initiatives to develop data space reference architectures or their implementations. This situation must change, ensuring their involve-ment.
.- Open data holders have extensive experience in data publishing, metadata management, quality indicators, dataset discovery and federation, as well as technologies and standards such as DCAT. However, there is very little transfer of knowledge and technology from the open data community to the data space community.";;;;N/A

- At the regional level (autonomous communities), through the sectoral open data group that meets periodically.
Bottom-up coordination is developed through periodic meetings and active listening actions through which the requests of local entities and organizations closely linked to citizens, such as the Network of local entities for transparency and citizen participation of the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces, and the Association of infomediary companies (ASEDIE) (bottom-up), are attended to. 
Likewise, we continue to strengthen ties with the developer communities.  Throughout 2021, the relationship with the following was consolidated: Hackathon Lovers, Comunidad R Hispano and R- Ladies Madrid.

22b;satisfactory;"Over the last 12 months there has been significant progress in the development of the action plans defined by public administrations in Spain.  

There are more and more open data initiatives that have gone from being mere lists of datasets as a tool to achieve transparency to become solid bets for quality publication through platforms that incorporate complementary services: search engines, uses, dialogue channels, etc. Some of them already appear at a higher stage and are linked to a global data strategy (unit responsible for information, governance policies and responsible use of data,...).

Two of the main reasons that we believe have given a positive impetus to this progress have been basically two:
.- Definition from Europe of the high value datasets that the public sector will have to open at the latest in 2024, and that sees the light in Spain through Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/138 of 21 December 2022 establishing a list of specific high value datasets and modalities of publication and reuse: https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=DOUE-L-2023-80077

Each of the datasets published in the National Catalog has a comment and remarks field, through which, users can report whether public sector agencies are charging for data above the marginal cost. These possible anomalies are evaluated by the platform administrator team. If any transgression of the current law is identified, the administrator will contact the publishing agency and refer them to their obligation to comply with the current law.

""The re-use of public sector information consists of the use by natural or legal persons of information generated by public sector bodies, for commercial or non-commercial purposes. Re-use involves, by way of illustration, activities such as copying, disseminating, modifying, adapting, extracting, rearranging and combining the information"".  

Following the incorporation of the provisions of the European Directive 2019/1024, Law 37/2007 includes a series of guidelines to ensure and encourage re-use: Offer data in machine-readable formats, with the highest level of accuracy, accessible, easy to find and locate, massively downloadable, in real time for dynamic data and published together with its metadata.

Currently, in the Initiative's implementation strategy, the following definition is included in the section ""Definition and application of progress and impact indicators"":  

Within the framework of the Aporta Initiative, impact is understood as: any positive effect or benefit obtained directly or indirectly for individuals, communities or society, which occurs over a certain period and which results from the development of different activities in each area characterised using open data to an end.

Attention will be paid to the definition and regular maintenance of progress and impact indicators for the opening and re-use of public sector information. To this end, and being aware of the difficulty involved in measuring impact, we will work on the approach to impact measurement that we have been following from the open data and reuse of public information initiative of the Government of Spain and which is inspired by the recommendations provided by several guides that we consider to be of reference in this aspect: the UNE 178301:2015 standard, the framework of common methods for the evaluation of open data, the guide for the empirical analysis of government open data initiatives and the taxonomy of the impact of open data. (...)  

See more here: https://datos.gob.es/sites/default/files/datosgobes/iniciativa_aporta_-_estrategiaejecucion_2021_v01.pdf (page 5)  

The method used to measure this impact is based on the two main components mentioned above: a quantitative analysis through indicators on data publication and its characteristics, and a qualitative analysis through the collection of data use cases. More details here: https://datos.gob.es/en/blog/measuring-impact-open-data

A summary of the main conclusions is available here: https://datos.gob.es/en/noticia/11th-edition-asedies-infomediary-sector-report-available  

-> In 2021, the National Centre for Geographic Information conducted a study with the University of Leuven to measure the benefit of publishing orthoimage as open data.  
The aim of the study was to find out the economic value and benefit of geographic data that are published through free and open services. To this end, the starting point was the central node of the IDEE (the Spanish spatial data infrastructure), understanding as such the services and data co-produced among the partners of the National Cartographic System (the nodes of the ministries, autonomous communities and local entities are not part of the scope of the study). These services are the ones that publish the data captured and financed by different administrations (orthophotos, LiDAR, transport networks...).  

The study contains two approaches:  
1. It has been compared what it costs to use the tessellations coming from Google Maps where it has been taken as a basis the Google Maps pricing system called ""Google map load"" and which is equivalent to a user session in a viewer where it charges 7$ for each map load. 
2. It has been compared with the charges that other countries apply for the use of downloading data and the use of web services (Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Finland and France).  
Adding a mini example from the study, the economic value of WMS and WMTS services used in 2020 would be 568 772 euros.

Transparency and accountability of public administrations to citizens are indicators of the quality of governments. More and more institutions at different levels (national, regional, and local) are launching portals and applications where citizens can learn about the activities carried out by the government, how they are done, and how much is invested in them. Private initiatives also join institutions, which demonstrate citizens' interest in the transparency of public institutions. Some examples are: 

-> Overview of the Budget of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia. This web application shows, through different viewers by year, the revenue and where the community's income is invested. It is also possible to see where the budgets' income comes from, how much it amounts to, or an approximation of how citizens' taxes are spent, based on their annual gross income.

To do so, the central node of the Spanish SDI (IDEE) was considered as the starting point, including the services and data co-produced among the partners of the National Cartographic System (nodes from ministries, autonomous regions, and local entities were not included in the study's scope). These services are the ones that publish data captured and financed by different administrations (orthophotos, LiDAR, transport networks, etc.). The study contains two approaches: 
- Firstly, the cost of using tiles from Google Maps was compared, using the pricing system known as ""Google Map Load,"" which charges $7 per map load in a user session. 
- Secondly, the rates applied by other countries for downloading data and using web services were compared (Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Finland, and France).

https://datos.gob.es/en/noticia/11th-edition-asedies-infomediary-sector-report-available 

Among the report's conclusions, the following stand out: 

-> The total number of employees is 22,663. Workers are highly concentrated in a few companies: 62% of them have less than 10 employees. The subsector with the highest number of professionals is geospatial information, with 30% of the total. Along with the Economic and Financial, Technical Consulting, and Market Research subsectors, they account for 75% of employees. 

-> Employment in Infomediary companies grew by 1.7%, compared to a 1.1% decline the previous year. All subsectors grew except for Tourism and Culture, which remained stable, and Technical Consulting and Market Research, which decreased. 

-> Average revenue per employee exceeded 100,000 euros, increasing by 6.6% compared to the previous year. Conversely, the average expense per employee was 45,000 euros.

Since the beginning of the initiative, the portalâs support and functional management team and the maintenance and progress team meet weekly to review and evaluate the changes necessary in the platform with the aim of correcting the incidents that arise, making the improvements identified to solve the problems that users encounter or to increase/enrich the functionalities it currently supports. The decisions that are adopted are executed by the platformâs progress, development and maintenance team, which makes the necessary technical and evolutionary adjustments. Control and monitoring are supervised using the Jira platform. Likewise, a monthly report is sent to publishers detailing the datasets that may present access problems as a result of a periodic process of checking broken links. In addition, these actions are reinforced annually with the user satisfaction survey and the individualised quality studies of the metadata that are carried out periodically.";;;;15

- The sections that are most useful to portal users are the data catalogue and the sections: infographics, current affairs (news, events, interviews), innovation blog and interact (documentation), . 
- The most valued services are the news and novelties service, harvesting and publication of datasets, the bulletin service, the guides and training material service and dashboard.
- The most useful actions for promoting data re-use are the publication of success stories, followed by training and publication of guides, and contests/challenges. 
Based on these suggestions, the generation of editorial content related to the aspects outlined continues to increase, through the following actions (with the number of new elements created last year):

105b;yes;"In addition to the dashboard mechanisms mentioned above, the portal has a backoffice that allows certain actions to be carried out by publishers to be monitored. These actions allow publishers to take action on the feedback they receive. The most relevant functionalities available are: 
- federation management console, through which publishers manage and schedule automatic data federation (harvesting) tasks. 
- check for broken links. This functionality allows publishers to see the results of the periodic broken link checks that the platform performs on the availability of the distributions published. 
- data availability, which makes it possible to manage data requests received by publishers, providing feedback to users and changing the status of each request based on the availability of new datasets. 
- comment management, to respond to comments on data sets received from users. 
- user management, which allows publishers to maintain user accounts authorised to interact with the portal.

These conditions are intended to facilitate and guarantee the re-use process, ensuring the persistence of information, the use of open formats, as well as the appropriate terms and conditions of use. Specifically, section III.5 of the NTI-RISP indicates that the information resources of periodic production or collection made available for re-use will be updated to their latest versions and the date of last update will be indicated, as well as the period of the update. 

In this sense, the initiative promotes the management of data sets published automatically and periodically via federation (harvesting). Through the federation console, publishers are informed when there has been a problem updating the metadata so that they can be corrected.";;;;20

The adaptations of the standard are necessary to ensure the aforementioned cross-border interoperability of the data catalogs made to reflect the high-value datasets, as agreed in the work sessions carried out by SEMIC, in which Spain has played an active role. In this line, Spain will take into account all the recommendations present in the implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138 and those that may arise in coordination in the aforementioned working groups regarding the preparation of the dataset itself and the standardized access mechanisms.

In addition, the open data working group, compoud by leaders of local entity data initiatives (FEMP), is preparing the revision of the guide for the publication of 80 datasets in all local entities in the country. These datasets will apply the technical guidelines of EU regulation (real time, API access, bulk download, granularity, etc.). Among other characteristics, homogeneous and interoperable data models (taking references at: https://www.fiware.org/smart-data-models/) are being defined and the general objectives are improve data quality, add spatial information, contribute to the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals and identify each dataset as HVD.";;;;20

Datasets that do not meet the quality standards established in the Spanish NTI-RISP compatible with DCAT are not allowed. The automatic federation mechanism or the manual upload method generates reports addressed to the publishers reporting when these quality standards are not met so that the metadata can be adjusted correctly. Changes are not saved to the dataset catalogue until they are successful. 
On the other hand, individualised audit processes are continuously carried out on publishers on the quality of metadata currently published on the portal. This audit follows the methodological approach of the Metadata Quality Assessment (MQA) proposed by the European Data Portal, evaluating the quality of metadata based on three complementary dimensions: discovery, interoperability and context. See evidence at: https://datos.gob.es/sites/default/files/datosgobes/dimension3_evidenciapregunta_92b_111a.jpg

113;Not Applicable;"RESPONSE TO REVIEWERS:

Spain's open data license is a license that fits the casuistry of our country. The text aims to make it easier for publishers to interpret this type of complex legal texts. 
The license in Spain is perfectly compatible and equivalent to a CC-BY 4.0 license.
..................................

Currently, the Initiative promotes the use of standard licenses for the re-use of public sector information in Spain. 
The current legislation (RD. Law 24/2021) in its Article 4. Administrative regime for re-use, indicates that open data publishers may provide standard licenses for the re-use of documents, which must be available in digital format and be processable electronically. The conditions incorporated in the licenses must respect the following criteria: 

a) They must be clear, fair and transparent. 
b) They must not restrict the possibilities of reuse or limit competition. 
c) They should not be discriminatory for comparable categories of re-use, including cross-border re-use. 

However, since 2011, the existing legal norm (RD 1495/2011) has already defined its own license, since when it was published in that year, the use of standard licenses for data was not common. Therefore, they specified simple terms of use specifically designed to encourage the re-use of public sector information. These conditions are compatible with the CC-BY 4.0 license. 

These conditions can be viewed at the following URL:
