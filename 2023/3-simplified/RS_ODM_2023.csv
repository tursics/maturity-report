based on several dimensions.
First the dimension of balancing lead and lag indicators. Lead indicators show whether the right
things to enable open data impact are happening (as no impact would be possible otherwise),
and lag indicators to assess what impact is visible.
Second, establishing indicators along the entire value chain that leads to socio-economic impact
of open data, as apparent from the reviewed research. This value chain runs from data provision,
government efficiency gains, demand and adoption, time and resource investment by external
stakeholders, re-use examples, policy implementation, ecosystem formation, to higher order
usage and network effects.
For the different steps in that chain, both lead and lag indicators can be put forward, along with
the methods to measure them where such experience exists in the research taken into account.
Third, indicators as much as possible should be of the ‘vector’ type (measuring direction and
speed), which more likely leads to more objective measurements. The exact list of indicators is available starting from page 53 of the publication.";In addition to the URL, please briefly describe the key points of the methodology;;;30
