National efforts on implementing EU high value datasets and national core datasets should give a significant impetus on the availability of dynamic data.;Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time). ;;;;15

However, the possibility to provide asset lists (of data that falls e.g. under the scope of the Data Governance Act) via data.gv.at is given. Effectively, this depends on the willingness of the data holders to provide this information. Data screening and monitoring by public sector bodies is encouraged, but it is not an obligation.;The Data Governance Act (EU) 2022/868 seeks to increase trust in data sharing, strengthen mechanisms to increase data availability and overcome technical obstacles to the reuse of data. It also aims to support the set-up and development of common European data spaces in strategic domains, involving both private and public players, in sectors such as health, environment, energy, agriculture, mobility, finance, manufacturing, public administration and skills.

For justification:
*Please describe what is the agreed approach.
* If less than the majority of data providers, please briefly explain why (e.g. technical incompatibilities, governance aspects, low awareness etc.).";the majority of public sector data providers;"According to a general agreement between the federal level, the states, cities and municipalities, all public sector data provided for re-use has to be published via the national data portal data.gv.at. In general, data provision is regulated by existing access regulations (or regulations concerning fees). Austria still lacks a Freedom of Information Law stipulating general access rules. Thus, public sector bodies are not yet obliged to publish data according to existing (sectoral or state) laws. The decision on publishing data effectively relies within the competent public sector bodies. In general, data re-use is granted on a voluntary basis. 

However, current government plannings and the government programme foresee major changes concerning freedom of information. Furthermore, additional concrete improvements are envisaged through the transposition of the EU Open Data and Public Sector Information Directive 2019/1024.

The data.gv.at platform is designed as a metadata aggregation portal. The data (resources) remain with the data holders. The data.gv.at portal serves as single point of access to available data and represents the full picture of Austria with regard to available Open Government Data. However, at the moment it is not possible to ascertain or control from a central perspective whether all public sector data providers contribute data to the portal, neither whether a completeness of all datasets can be achieved. Obviously there is still major potential for improvements, in particular with regard to data being provided by the states, cities and municipalities.

The data.gv.at portal offers a data storage and distribution functionality, above all for small data providers, which allows for an upload of data by the data holders themselves. The contractual basis for the usage of this functionality depends on a number of parameters (eg. file size). The feature is free of charge for smaller file uploads.";Providers at federal, regional or local level, directly or indirectly, via direct uploading or harvesting of metadata. ;;;;12

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe your approach.";yes;"General Information about best practices is provided on data.gv.at. The Cooperation OGD Austria serves as a forum for continuous exchange and dialogue.

Response to reviewers:
We have a structured approach to ensure that metadata is kept up-to-date, consistent with the characteristics and requirements of individual datasets. The approach involves several components:

1. Data Stewardship: Each dataset is assigned to a data steward responsible for its upkeep.
2. Time-Triggered Updates: Some datasets have predefined schedules for updates, which are built into our system to automatically prompt the responsible data steward.
3.  Event-Triggered Updates: Other datasets are updated when specific events occur (e.g., legislative changes, significant weather events).
4.  User Feedback Mechanism: Users can report issues with the metadata, which are then reviewed and acted upon.
5. Cooperation OGD Austria Forum: This serves as a platform for data providers and stakeholders to discuss best practices, challenges, and methods for keeping data and metadata up-to-date.
6.  Quality Checks: Automated and manual quality checks are performed to ensure metadata accuracy.
7. Documentation: Best practices and guidelines for metadata updating are documented and provided to all data stewards and contributors.

By combining these methods, we ensure that our metadata is accurate, reliable, and up-to-date, meeting the varying requirements of different types of data.";Please note that a regular updating of metadata refers here to an updating that is in line with the characteristics of the dataset in question. Different datasets have different requirements of currency.

response to reviewers:
To ensure the interoperability of high-value datasets, especially alongside the datasets of other countries, we have developed a multi-pronged strategy:

1.Standardization: Following the EU guidelines and the implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138, we are standardizing the data structures, formats, and metadata for high-value datasets to ensure cross-border compatibility.
2. API Development: We are working on the development and deployment of APIs that conform to international standards, allowing for easier data exchange and integration between different countries.
3. Cross-Border Collaboration: Initiatives are being undertaken to collaborate with neighboring countries and EU member states to create seamless data exchange platforms, particularly for datasets that have cross-border implications.
4. Quality Assurance: Automated and manual checks are being implemented to ensure that the interoperable datasets maintain a high level of quality and reliability.
5. User & Stakeholder Feedback: An open channel for user and stakeholder feedback is being maintained to identify issues and make the necessary adjustments.
6. Legal & Ethical Compliance: Ensuring that cross-border data sharing complies with legal and ethical standards is a priority. Therefore, legal teams are involved to ensure that the data sharing is in line with GDPR and other regulations.

Challenges:
1. Data Harmonization: One of the challenges is the harmonization of data collected through different methods and standards across countries.
2. Technical Hurdles: Ensuring that different data platforms can communicate effectively with each other presents technical challenges.
3. Data Governance: Ensuring that all data providers adhere to the agreed-upon standards and governance models can be difficult.
