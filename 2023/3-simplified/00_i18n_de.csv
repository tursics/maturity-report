G1;Die Antwortoption „Sonstige“ sollte von Ländern gewählt werden, die über keine spezifische Open-Data-Politik verfügen, aber über eine nationale Politik (zu Daten, Digitalisierung, künstlicher Intelligenz, E-Government o.ä.) verfügen, die Open Data explizit in ihren Text und Geltungsbereich einbezieht.
G100;By active we refer to an account that publishes new materials at least once a week. A social media presence may include a Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn account that regularly published open data related content. Ideally a social media account would help promote the open data and more specific portal activities and increase visibility of the open data published on the national portal. 
G101;Actions could be regular promotion of the portal’s data and activities at events, an active social media presence, organising webinars to present the available datasets, use cases, the portal’s features to the broader public etc.
G105b;Such mechanisms could refer to statistics that show publishers statistics concerning their data: the volume of published datasets/metadata records, information on quality of publication (formats, DCAT-AP compliance, licensing information), usage statistics such as downloads, visits, or use cases uploaded to the national portal referencing their data.
G106;Please note that a regular updating of metadata refers here to an updating that is in line with the characteristics of the dataset in question. Different datasets have different requirements of currency. For example, a gazetteer of city streets only changes when new buildings and roads are built, or street names are changed, whereas the data on current weather conditions may be updated in quasi-real time.
G109;This applies both to individual datasets that change in time and to archives of the same dataset, e.g. one every year, every month etc. Administrative geography is an example of data that changes regularly. When new houses are built, new postcodes may be created, and the areas referred by pre-existing postcodes may change. Making available previous versions of a postcode reference file enables the reuser to correctly interpret the meaning of a postcode vs the relevant time context.
G10a;The implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138, adopted in December 2022 and published in January 2023 by the European Commission, lays down a list of specific high-value datasets and the arrangements for their publication and re-use. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023R0138
G10b;Stakeholders could refer to open data reusers (business, civil society) or other actors that might not be direct reusers of the data (e.g. engaged or interested citizens).
G10c;The implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138, adopted in December 2022 and published in January 2023 by the European Commission, lays down a list of specific high-value datasets and the arrangements for their publication and re-use. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023R0138
G110;"* The implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138, adopted in December 2022 and published in January 2023 by the European Commission, lays down a list of specific high-value datasets and the arrangements for their publication and re-use. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023R0138
* Interoperability is the ability to access and process data from different sources and being able to integrate that data for mapping, visualisation, and other forms of representation and analysis."
G111b;Such information can be made available as visualisations (e.g. the MQA tool of the EDP), or as downloadable file (ideally in .csv format) on the national portal.
G112;Such guidelines can take the form of a document or tools (a licensing assistant) available on the national portal. An example of such tool is the data.europa.eu Licensing Assistant: https://data.europa.eu/en/training/licensing-assistant.
G118;Guidelines (check-lists) can enable publishers provide their data in open and machine-readable formats (.csv or .xml instead of proprietary non-machine-readable formats). Other tools can assist publishers to clean up the actual data (e.g. OpenRefine, programming languages such as R).
G119a;By ‘regularly’ we mean a bi-annual or at least annual frequency for activities such as e-learning modules and materials, webinars, meetings. Incentivisation can include the promotion of good quality datasets, e.g. featuring them on the portal homepage, showcasing the publishers as best practices at data providers’ events. Assistance can be provided through formal processes (e.g. data audits), training sessions with data providers, other training and/or awareness raising activities (‘roadshows’) etc.
G119b;By ‘high-quality metadata’ we refer to metadata that provides information in plain language – accurate, current and complete, on all DCAT-AP mandatory fields as well as relevant recommended and optional DCAT-AP fields.
G11a;Please find for reference the European Commission´s priorities for 2019-2024: https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024_en
G11a1;Example: Green mobility has been prioritised as high-value dataset.
G11a2;Example 1: The strategy explores how open data can be used to foster the digitalisation of public services.                                                                                                                 Example 2: The strategy/policies foresee open data education projects to improve data literacy among citizens.
G11a3;Example: One of the objectives of my country´s open data policies/strategies is to create economic value by stimulating new buiness opportunities.
G11a4;Example: Gender inequality has been prioritised as high-value dataset.
G11a5;Example: Migration has been prioritised as high-value dataset.
G11a6;Example: One of the objectives of my country´s policies/strategies is to increase transparency and facilitate public participation in policy debates.
G11b;Example: Fight corruption,increase transparency in public administrations.
G120;See https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/
G121;For more information, please see https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/catalogue/distribution/dcat-ap-version-11
G125a;According to the DCAT-AP definition, the ‘download URL’ property contains a URL that is a direct link to a downloadable file in a given format.
G125b;According to the DCAT-AP definition, the ‘access URL’ property contains a URL that gives access to a distribution of the dataset. 
G126;For more information, please visit: http://5stardata.info/en/ or https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/W3C04.pdf.
G128b;"Refers to open data that is available on the web under an open licence, in a structured format (=machine-readable format that is proprietary, such as .xls; .xlsx). Please note that formats such as .pdf; .jpeg; .png, .doc(x) are not considered machine-readable formats and should hence not be counted towards this answer."
G128c;Refers to open data that is published in an open (=non-proprietary) machine-readable format. A non-proprietary format is a format for which a user does not require a proprietary software package (such as Microsoft Office Excel) to explore. An example of an open format is the comma-separated values (CSV) format for tabular data.
G128d;"Refers to open data whose comprising objects are accompanied by unique identifiers. An identifier may be the object’s name (e.g. city name ‘Luxembourg’, or ‘10717’ -- a Berlin postcode), or a word describing the object (‘population’; ‘gender’), or another arbitrary identifier such as ‘XYZ0’, an identifier that makes sense only in the context of that dataset. Choosing identifiers based on known standards should be the common practice though, to facilitate data integration and linked data."
G15;By initiatives we mean policies, strategies or portals that focus on the respective local/regional level.
G2;The answer option 'Not applicable' can be selected if e.g. there is no specific strategy in place, but the existing policy refers to the objectives, actions/measures to be implemented, delivery timelines, responsible etc. Should another explanation apply in your case, please provide it in the justification text box.
G20;Exchanges can take place via formal formats (e.g. round-tables, conferences) or less formal formats (e.g. meet-ups).
G21;For data publication plans we refer to the existence of a specific workflow or internal data management process for publication of datasets. 
G25a;E.g. a task force/agency that is in charge of promoting and assisting the data publication process at national and/or regional and local levels (where applicable).
G25b;Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time).
G25c;Geo-spatial data is data that contains information on properties that are linked to a position on earth.
G25d; Citizen-generated data is the data that people or their organisations produce to directly monitor, demand or drive change on issues that affect them.
G26a;Ideally such trainings are organised in the frame of the professional development programmes for civil servants and address both data literacy and skills.
G29;"With 'national level' we refer to either central government, federal government, or top ministries.
Examples of such activities could be regular information sessions and/or promotion of published data at conferences and other events. "
G31;Incentives could for example be training, financial incentives, or awards.
G32;The implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138, adopted in December 2022 and published in January 2023 by the European Commission, lays down a list of specific high-value datasets and the arrangements for their publication and re-use. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023R0138
G34;With methodology we refer to practices, frameworks, methods developed/employed, regardless of their maturity level.
G40;"The governmental impact is hereby defined as the beneficial effect of the use of open data on three specific challenges faced by the government/public administrations: 1) Being efficient and effective in delivering public services; 2) Being transparent and accountable in their actions; 3) Improving their capacity to make decisions and policies."
G45;The social impact is hereby defined as the beneficial effect of the use of open data on four specific challenges for society: 1) Including minorities, migrants, and/or refugees  and reducing inequality, 2) Alleviating housing issues, 3) Fostering health and wellbeing, 4) Improving education.
G47;Data that provides information on the housing market, rental market, property valuations, sales, planning, zoning, census data on socio-economic variables for cities and/or neighbourhoods, other housing issues such as homelessness, empty dwellings, gentrification.
G50;The environmental impact is hereby defined as the beneficial effect of the use of open data on four specific challenges connected to the environment: 1) Protecting biodiversity (e.g. maintaining a good level of air and water quality), 2) Achieving more environmental-friendly cities (e.g. in terms of transport and waste management), 3) Fighting climate change and connected disasters, 4) Increasing the use of renewable sources of energy.
G55;"The economic impact is hereby defined as the beneficial effect of the use of open data on three indicators of economic growth:  
1) Level of employment, 2) Uptake of technology and innovation, 3) Level of etrepreneurship and new business created."
G65;An example of such supporting material could be relevant studies or reports associated with the dataset e.g. documenting how the data was produced, the methodology etc.
G66a;Please note that a general email address does not count as feedback mechanism in the sense of this question and will not be scored as such.
G66b;The feedback mechanism does not include the possibility of a user to send in an email to a general address/the helpdesk.
G66c;Such mechanism could be a star rating system or similar voting/rating mechanism.
G69a;Please note also that a specific “Request data” button is meant here. Should the data request function be accomplished by a general help desk contact form that has a specific field for data requests, please describe this as such in the justification box.
G69c;A transparent presentation of these requests may be a machine-readable file on the national portal, or a separate section on the national portal that lists these requests. By providing a list of these requests, duplication of requests can be avoided, and time saved in filtering and answering these duplicate requests.
G6a;Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time). 
G6b;"Geo-spatial data is data that contains information on properties that are linked to a position on earth.

G6c;Citizen-generated data is the data that people or their organisations produce to directly monitor, demand or drive change on issues that affect them.
G7;These measures should promote concepts such as data-driven government, policy-making and decision-making.
G78;Meaning the portal renders well on both mobile and desktop.
GR8;This is the annual budget for all portal activities (portal development and maintenance, promotion and awareness-raising activities) of the national portal. This should include the budget for the national portal team, whether an internal team or external contractors.
G8;These measures could promote concepts such as smart cities and/or regions, but also new business development (in particular Small - and Medium-sized Enterprises), entrepreneurship etc.
G82;Unique visitors refer to the number of distinct individuals accessing pages on the website during a given period, regardless of how often they visit that website. Visits refer to the number of times a website is visited, no matter how many visitors make up those visits.
G90b;Here we are interested in distinguishing the volume of traffic generated by human users vs the traffic generated programmatically by API usage. We ask for outgoing traffic as it is more relevant than incoming traffic: the former is generated by the enquiries, but the latter by the responses.
G91;Providers at federal, regional or local level, directly or indirectly, via direct uploading or harvesting of metadata. 
G94a;Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time).
G95;Citizen-generated data is the data that people or their organisations produce to directly monitor, demand or drive change on issues that affect them.
G97;This function can be useful towards reducing the amount of Freedom of Information requests for data that is transparently justified why it cannot be opened. The national portal might also publish the reasons for preventing publication, e.g. national security.
G98;A strategy could be a brief document and/or action plan listing the activities planned to ensure the portal’s sustainability over time.
G9a;A data inventory is a comprehensive catalogue of datasets held by an organisation.
G9b;The Data Governance Act (EU) 2022/868 seeks to increase trust in data sharing, strengthen mechanisms to increase data availability and overcome technical obstacles to the reuse of data. It also aims to support the set-up and development of common European data spaces in strategic domains, involving both private and public players, in sectors such as health, environment, energy, agriculture, mobility, finance, manufacturing, public administration and skills. The Data Governance entered into force on 23 June 2022 and, following a 15-month grace period, will be applicable from September 2023. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R0868

N1;Bitte beachten Sie, dass in diesem Abschnitt zwischen Open-Data-Politik und Open-Data-Strategie unterschieden wird. Unter Politik versteht man hier alle Grundsätze/Initiativen, die darauf abzielen, die in der Richtlinie über offene Daten festgelegten Ziele zu erreichen, einschließlich spezifischer nationaler Rechtsvorschriften zur Umsetzung des EU-Rechts. Mit der Strategie hingegen definieren wir ein Dokument, in dem die konkrete Vision, Mission, Ziele, umzusetzenden Maßnahmen, Zeitrahmen und Verantwortlichkeiten dargelegt werden. Eine Open-Data-Strategie würde idealerweise Informationen zur Open-Data-Governance-Struktur und zum Betriebsmodell enthalten.
N2;Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.
N3;"This part of the questionnaire is dedicated to assessing the solution your country chose for making the available open data discoverable. Typically, this is achieved through a national open data portal. 
For simplicity, the following section will refer to this solution as the “national portal”.    
Please provide where requested the URLs to the features inquired with the respective question. If access to the feature is restricted (back-end feature, log-in required), please provide a screenshot via e-mail as additional attachment (and note this here in the questionnaire). Please answer the questions below only in relation to the portal you indicated as the national portal of reference. Only URLs documenting the features available on this portal will be considered and scored."
N4;In section 4.3 `DCAT-AP Compliance`, the focus is on DCAT-AP exclusively. We are aware that many of the respondents may be compliant with other EU standards, such as INSPIRE. For the purpose of this assessment, only DCAT-AP and its country-specific profiles are relevant.
