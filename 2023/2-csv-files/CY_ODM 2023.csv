;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

(i) Midgrate:  The app aims to assist migrants to become better integrated to the Cypriot society, including their financial integration. The app is suitable for legal migrants, refugees and asylum seekers who currently live in Cyprus and may use the app for getting useful information about legal rights, news, language courses, how-to procedures, etc. (social integration) as well as to examine available vacancies, build their profile and CV and apply for those vacancies (financial integration).
The project addresses various barriers that migrants face when they legally enter Cyprus (i.e. hard to reach the job market, migrants do not know how to create their CVs, how to apply for vacancies, many vacancies are in Greek, access to information is limited, info is static, migrants do not know their rights) but also barriers for employers who are willing to offer jobs and employment opportunities for migrants (i.e. employers are afraid to hire migrants for legal reasons, employers are overwhelmed with job applications). An important innovation of the Mindgrate mobile app is that it validates the legal status of its users so that employers feel safer about job applications coming to them through this app.

b. Provision of Structured Training Program to Open Data Liaison Officer
c. Provision of OnBoarding Program for new PSBs";By ‘regularly’ we mean a bi-annual or at least annual frequency for activities such as e-learning modules and materials, webinars, meetings. Incentivisation can include the promotion of good quality datasets, e.g. featuring them on the portal homepage, showcasing the publishers as best practices at data providers’ events. Assistance can be provided through formal processes (e.g. data audits), training sessions with data providers, other training and/or awareness raising activities (‘roadshows’) etc.;;;;15

* If applicable, please provide the URL to the documentation of the national DCAT-AP extension.";yes;"There is a slight national variation of the DCAT-AP. More precisely the national variation has more  mandatory classes than the EU standard. In other words some recommended classes, such as  ""frequency"" are mandatory under the national variation.
The reason for doing so was to achieve uniformity for datasets published by the various Public Sectors Bodies on the National Open Data Portal. (for more see metadata section of the: http://www.data.gov.cy/technical-guidelines).";;;;;5

126;"Do you use a model (such as the 5-Star Open Data or FAIR) to assess the quality of deployment of data in your country?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe.";yes;The 5-star model is adopted through the National Technical Guidelines for publishing datasets on the portal. As a general rule only datasets with a 3-star rating or above, are published on the portal. Exceptions are allowed only in the case that the publishing PSB provides a plan for the provison of those datasets in a 3-star rating (see national technical guidelines).;For more information, please visit: http://5stardata.info/en/ or https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/W3C04.pdf.;;;;15
