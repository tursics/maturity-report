R9;"Are you satisfied with data.europa.eu as a European single point of access?

For Justification:
* If you selected 'yes', what do you consider particularly good about data.europa.eu as European single point of access? 
* If you selected 'no', how would you improve data.europa.eu as European single point of access? ";no;Since the number of datasets is more tha 1500000, it is almost impossible to find anything across the EU in the EDP UI. So, the question is how to improve the search for users. Moreover, since many states have national specifics, for example the Czech Republic has a differently structured conditions of use, some metadata information is impossible to insert into data.europa.eu in a comprehensible way. But we consider it natural, data.europa.eu is more general portal than national ones. So the question is -single point of access for whom? Probably not for everone. For Czechs it will still be more convenient to go to Czech National Open Data Portal for Czech open data. But for searching for data outside the Czech Republic it is better to use data.europa.eu;;;;;N/A

;"Please note that this section differentiates between open data policy and open data strategy. Policy here refers to all principles/initiatives set out to achieve the goals established by the Open Data Directive, including specific national legislation put in place to transpose the EU law. With strategy, on the other hand, we define a document outlining the concrete vision, mission, objectives, measures to be implemented, timeline and responsible. An open data strategy would ideally include information on the open data governance structure and operating model.

See https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/1999-106.;Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time). ;;;;15

*  Could you briefly describe why this model was chosen/works best for your country?";top-down;At the beginning of the process of data opening, a bottom-up approach worked in the Czech Republic - a few providers decided to open data in a good quality as a result of small local iniciatives. Subsequently, a public body (the National Open Data Team) was created within the hybrid governance model to assist these providers, but still without support of legislation. Currently, the data opening takes place within the top-down model, where the obligation to open data is anchored by the principle of open data by default, and all affected entities must participate in the process, cooperate with the National Open Data Team and publish open data in the National Open Data Catalog.;;;;;N/A

;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

For justification:
* If yes, which tool(s) do you use?";no ;The National Open Data Team uses the Google Search Consol Insights to have a general overview of the number of searches or clicks, or their geographical origin. We do not use cookies or Google Analytics instruments as we do not think that this kind of activity is in accordance with open data principles, especially the possibility of free (unconditional) sharing and re-use of data. If data is to be open, sharing it is an objective and therefore does not make sense restrict it in any way. Moreover, using third-party cookies especially legated to the Google instruments means to send data about users to the countries outside EU where we have no control over. However, several data providers monitor their local portal´s traffic (for example the Czech Social Security Administration,  the Ministry of Labour and Social Issues, the Czech Statistical Office, the  State Administration of Land Surveying and Cadastr, the Ministry of Agricutlure, the Ministry of Health, the Czech Telecommunication Office, Region Hradec Králové, the City of Brno).

* If yes, please briefly describe your approach.";yes;"Responses to reviewer:

There is no mandatory part of the metadata record that would have to be updated when the data is updated. However, the quality of all metadata records can be monitored directly on the Open Data Portal, through which the Open Data Team informs the providers of discrepancies. The information on the status of the metadata is then further compiled in the Annual Open Data Status Report (see https://data.gov.cz/p%C5%99%C3%ADlohy/v%C3%BDro%C4%8Dn%C3%AD-zpr%C3%A1vy/V%C3%BDro%C4%8Dn%C3%AD%20zpr%C3%A1va%20o%20stavu%20otev%C5%99en%C3%BDch%20dat%20v%20%C4%8Cesk%C3%A9%20republice%20za%20rok%202022.pdf), which is reported directly to government, putting pressure on providers to ensure that the quality of the data and metadata is as high as possible and regularly updated. In addition, the most important providers are part of the Open Data Working Group under the Government's Information Society Council ""RVIS"". At all meetings of the group, which are led by the national Open Data Team, they are informed of the need to regularly update metadata and the data itself (meetings are held 4 times a year, see RVIS Annual Report where the emphasis on metadata is specifically mentioned https://www.vlada.cz/assets/ppov/rvis/vyrocni_zpravy/Zprava-o-cinnosti-RVIS-od-1--1--do-31--12--2022.pdf ).";Please note that a regular updating of metadata refers here to an updating that is in line with the characteristics of the dataset in question. Different datasets have different requirements of currency.

1. Terms of use of distributions of datasets are structured in a more complex way to be compliant with Czech legislation - see https://opendata.gov.cz/cinnost:stanoveni-podminek-uziti.
