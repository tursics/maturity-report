-	Also, in 2021, the Government adopted the National Programme for the promotion of development and use of Artificial Intelligence (2025), which recognizes Open Data and National Open Data Portal as important elements/infrastructure in the process.

According to the Access to Public Information Act, which transposes the EU Open Data Directive, (Article 10.b) – the open Data policy – obligations of the public sector bodies are as follows:
Article 10.b – Slovenian Access to Public Information Act
(1) The public sector bodies should allow re-use of public sector information by publication on the World Wide Web by publishing in open formats and in machine-readable form, together with metadata, except where this would involve disproportionate effort, going beyond a simple operation.
(2) The authorities should publish at the national open data portal a list of all databases within its competence with the relevant metadata and databases as such in the form of open data or links to websites where these are published as open data.
(3) Anyone may re-use the data published on the national open data portal, free of charge, under the conditions that:
-         Re-use of data is carried out in accordance with the law governing the protection of personal data and
-         At each re-use the user provides the source of data.

2022 amendments to the Access to Public Information Act implemented the part of the Open Data Directive on High Value Datasets.

Regarding the field of Open Science - st the end of March 2022, the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the Resolution on the Slovenian Scientific Research and Innovation Strategy 2030 which was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia in April 2022. This is a key Slovenian strategic document for research and innovation until 2030 and is based on the Article 10 of the new Scientific Research and Innovation Activities Act, which introduces Open Science as an important integral part of the scientific research. In the context of the horizontal objectives under Item 6.2., the Strategy defines six key measures in the field of Open Science, as follows:
1. Effective management and financing of the development of the national Open Science ecosystem and related national structures and infrastructures, ensuring their international alignment as well as integration into international associations and infrastructures.
2. Introduction of modern approaches to the evaluation of scientific research activity in accordance with Open Science principles to increase the quality and impact of research (e.g., DORA - San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment, Leiden Manifesto for Research Metrics, ERAC - European Research Area and Innovation Committee Guidelines).
3. Ensuring that the results of scientific research comply with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), and that full and immediate open access is provided (subject to legitimate exceptions).
4. Establishment of a National Open Science Community for the introduction and monitoring of Open Science in Slovenia, as well as its integration into ERA and beyond.
5. Promoting the development of citizen science and public involvement in scientific research.
6. Promoting the development of a national scientific publishing system to operate according to the principles of Open Science.
These measures, which are recognised as essential for the development of Open Science in Slovenia, will be the  basis for the Action Plan on Open Science, which is in the process of preparation.

Slovenian Government adopted (April 2015) a Strategy on development of public administration 2015-2020. The strategy had a special section devoted to transparency, re-use and open data (Chapter 6.4.1). On the basis of this Strategy, the Action plan of the Slovenian Government 2018-2019 provided for the following fundamental commitments  in this field, which continue to be followed by the public sector bodies - open data publishers:
oGreat emphasis has been put on the online publication of public sector open data, i.e. data in open, machine-readable formats, which enables anyone: citizens, non-governmental organisations, media, etc to further reuse them.
oGood practice in the reuse of public sector data shows that applications with significant added value may be created on the basis of raw public data.
•Therefore, it must be ensured that bodies will open their data for re-use, especially through the Slovenian open data portal – Portal OPSI 
•In accordance with the transposition of the Open Data Directive, additional activities have been anticipated in this field (legal framework, hackathons, data challenges, consultations, guidelines, up-date of the open data portal etc).
•Regarding databases of the public sector, special attention has been paid to the provision of transparency in terms of what sort of databases have been managed by public administration bodies (clear metadata), and of better connectivity between those databases, in order to provide simple access of citizens and other public administration bodies to data.

Strategic Working Plan for Open Data 2022-2023 includes the following measures (some of which have already been concluded), inter alia:
• preparing a list of high value data sets - HVDs
• amendments to the Act on Access to Public Information
• Preparation of the first amendments to the Decreeon transmission and reuse of public information
• Preparation of a list of high-value databases (based on the implementing Act of the European Commission of Dec. 2022) and preparation of the second amendment to the Decreeon transmission and reuse of public information
• International cooperation in the field of open data
• Establishment of a single information point in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Data Governance Act (DGA)
• Participation in the preparation of the new Strategy for the Development of Digital Services in Public Administration and the Development Strategy of Slovenia 2030
• Adding more datasets from the museums, public undertaking, municipalities and local governments to the national portal
• Implementation of open data training for civil servants at the Administrative Academy of the Ministry of Public Administration
• Improve the quality, quantity and scope of open data and associated metadata (applies to data providers (editors at authorities)).
• Improve the quality and range of services provided through the OPSI portal
o Stylistic redesign of the portal (renewal of menus and front page)
o Additional functionalities to help the work of content and chief editors (suggest a correction, a new collection - addition of functionality, notifications to users, etc.)
• Establishment of the OPSI API module
• Establishment of the OPSI LAB module
• Revision of the Manual for opening of public sector data (December 2023)

o Open data awareness
o Reuse of government open data from various fields(environment, society, ...)
o Increasing the efficiency of public services
o Projects, studies on the benefits of open data
o Projects, studies on the effects of open data from an environmental, social, political or economic impact

- The Digital (TRansformation) Strategy 2030 (March 2023) defines data as a strategic raw material and driver of a smart society 5.0 and emphasizes that it is extremely important to provide up-to-date, timely and comprehensive data. It emphasizes the importance of high-value data from six thematic areas: geospatial data; observing the Earth and the environment; meteorological data; statistics; businesses and business ownership; mobility. The aim of the data strategy is to facilitate the sharing of data and thereby accelerate the use of data, including open data.
-The aim is to establish a dynamic data ecosystem, with data standards and tools, in which data providers, data analysts and application developers who, in cooperation and partnership, will be able to develop data applications that will offer smart digital services as responses to social challenges. 
-The data ecosystem which will be founded upon the national open data portal will thus represent the basis of innovation and entrepreneurship.
-In this way, the 2030 Strategy follows one of the goals of the European Data Strategy, which aims to establish a single data space in the European Union, which will consist of different substantive data spaces.

4;not applicable;In Slovenia, we do not have regions, but due to the large number of municipalities (212) and small population in municipalities (https://sl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seznam_ob%C4%8Din_v_Sloveniji ), this type of policy is prepared at the national level and coordinated with the local level. All state policies are coordinated with all stakeholders, including the local communities, during the process. Due to the specificity of the organization of local self-government and the lack of an intermediate management level in the form of regions (no regions), all policies for the area of open data are prepared at the national level.

According to the Slovenian Open Data policy the central role has been performed by the Ministry of Public Administration- MPA that runs the national Open Data portal, and at the same time has the central editorial role, meaning that it is the central point to keep the network of editors at various ministries and state bodies active. 
This has been done by regular e-mails on the novelties regarding the portal, by the educational activities regarding Open Data at the Administrative Academy of the MPA, bi-lateral meetings and annual meetings for all the editors (e.g. https://podatki.gov.si/content/delovno-sre%C4%8Danje-urednikov-portala-opsi )
The opening of PSI is promoted also on the basis of the Manual of Open Data (2016): https://podatki.gov.si/posredovanje-podatkov. 
The re-use of data within the public sector has been encouraged also by the Guidelines for Development of Applications (2020): https://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/smernice+mju+za+razvoj+informacijskih+resitev-768 ; these Guidelines contain a special section on Open Data (section 6.2) which emphasizes the importance of using Open Data when developing new applications in the public sector.
Support has been given also by the national open data portal editors to the local authorities who also publish data at the national open data portal in the form of workshops (e.g. a workshop on 8. March 2021, in relation to an IoT call for smart cities that will encourage local communities to establish a real-time data flow through IoT sensors):

8;yes;"The measures include actions supporting the reuse of open data by the public sector:
- Collaboration with the Chamber of Commerce of Slovenia in the form of the »Open Data Hub« (regular events, consultations with the actors from the private sector)
- Collaboration with the academia, Universities and students (Hackathons, presentations on Open Data to the students, preparation of the open data projects by the students)
- Collaboration with the civil society (NGOs etc)

The national Digital (TRansformation) Strategy 2030 (adopted by the Government in March 2023) specifically emphasises the importance of supporting re-use of open data by the private sector (page 29-last paragraph and 30-first paragraph):
»Based on the example of the public sector, the private sector should also be encouraged to open up and exchange data, where appropriate. In Slovenia, the first step in this direction was the establishment of the Open Data Hub of Slovenia (OPSI Hub), whose founders were Tehnološki Park Ljubljana d.o.o. and the Chamber of Commerce of Slovenia (ZIT), with the support of the Ministry of Public Administration. The OPSI portal represents a good basis on which private sector databases (the so-called data market, etc.) will be transparently presented and made available under different conditions (e.g. different licenses, SLAs). The goal is to facilitate the voluntary publication of data by companies and in this way accelerate the use of data as a raw material of the digital society«.

In 2019 the MPA started to work with the Chamber of Commerce of Slovenia and organised a first meeting on Open Data and Digital Economy: https://ikthm.gzs.si/Novice/ArticleId/70728/odprti-podatki-javnega-sektorja-in-digitalno-gospodarstvo. In March 2020 the MPA started a long-term collaboration with the Chamber of Commerce and founded together ""the Open Data Hub"", the goal of which is to promote use of open data by the companies: https://podatki.gov.si/content/ustanovitev-sti%C4%8Di%C5%A1%C4%8Da-za-odprte-podatke-slovenije. 
Also in May 2020, the MPA and the Open Data Hub organised an on-line conference: Open Data - accelerators of the economy: https://www.gov.si/novice/2020-05-07-konferenca-odprti-podatki-pospesevalci-digitalne-ekonomije/. The minister of public administration, Mr. Bostjan Koritnik opened the conference: https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MJU/Open-Data-nagovor-ministra-07052020.docx We intend to continue this collaboration.

In practice this information has been published at the OPSI portal; for example metadata on 47 datasets of the MPA are available here: https://podatki.gov.si/data/search?publisher=ministrstvo_za_javno_upravo&q=Ministrstvo+za+javno+upravo  The list of metadata has been prescribed in the Annex 1 of the Decree: http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/npb/2016-01-0994-p1.pdf";;;;15

The amendments to the Decree on provision and re-use of public information  of Nov. 2022 included the amendments to the list of metadata (Annex 1), so that these include now the special metadata denoting some datasets as »a HVD«; the national open data portal was upgraded correspondingly. The majority of the datasets that form HVDs have already been marked, at the national open data portal, as »a HVD«.

The representative of the public bodies had various questions that we tried to solve. The toughest ones we intend to solve in the scope of the “first face-to-face data.europa.eu Workshop” that will take place in Ljubljana from 22-23 May and will be hosted by the Slovenian Ministry of Digital Transformation and the Ministry of Public Administration. The event will bring together member states’ administrations and the EC’s expertise to ensure smooth adoption of the new policy. In the workshop, we will cover the EU policy landscape and discuss how to translate policy to practice ensuring an aligned implementation. **** Added August: the Commissions regulation 2023/138 has been to quite some extent already applied in Slovenia. The Government already in 2022 adopted the Annex 2 to the Decree where it specified which national datasets are “HVDS” and must be published via APIs.

11b;Yes;"ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION AND OPEN DATA REGARDED AS MUTUALLY REINFORCING
In Slovenia, the right of access to public information is enshrined in the Constitution. This year (2023) Slovenia ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Access to Official Documents which is the only international treaty regarding the access to public information. 
https://www.coe.int/en/web/access-to-official-documents 
The ratification coincides with the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the first Access to Public Information Law in Slovenia, adopted in 2003. This all forms a very strong foundation for the right to access public information, on the basis of that comes proactive transparency, via web portals, including as Open Data. Therefore the access to public information constitutional and legal framework and the policies regarding Open Data are mutually reinforcing.

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND TRANSPARENCY
- the Access to Public Information Act – promotes general transparency of the money flows from the public to the private sector
- the Integrity and Prevention of Corruption Act
the explicit provisions on obligatory publishing of data on all financial transactions of public sector bodies as Open Data, Article 75.b, see Para 13, were introduced by the amendments of October 2020

The application ERAR, run by the Commision for Prevention of Corruption of Slovenia,  has been mentioned as the pioneering practice in the recent Handbook of good practices in the fight against corruption prepared by the European Commision (see page 15): 
https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/handbook-good-practices-fight-against-corruption-2023-02-15_en  Programme of Government of Republic of Slovenia to strengthen integrity and transparency in Public Sector 2023-2026 which was adopted in Feb 2023 therefore also includes the measure 3A.1c »TRANSPARENCY – PROMOTE PUBLIC DATA PUBLICATION IN OPEN FORMATS«. The purpose of the measures is to train civil servants and officials in government and ministries on the importance of data, its management and the value of opening up data in terms of transparency and its impact on the functioning of society. The final aim is to empower public officials and public servants to take into account the relevance of data for the wider benefit of society in the performance of their duties;

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Also, in 2021, the Government adopted the National Programme for the promotion of development and use of Artificial Intelligence (2025), which recognizes Open Data and National Open Data Portal as important elements/infrastructure in the process.

OPEN SCIENCE
At the end of March 2022, the National Assembly of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the Resolution on the Slovenian Scientific Research and Innovation Strategy 2030 which was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia in April 2022. This is a key Slovenian strategic document for research and innovation until 2030 and is based on the Article 10 of the new Scientific Research and Innovation Activities Act, which introduces Open Science as an important integral part of the scientific research. In the context of the horizontal objectives under Item 6.2., the Strategy defines six key measures in the field of Open Science, as follows:
1. Effective management and financing of the development of the national Open Science ecosystem and related national structures and infrastructures, ensuring their international alignment as well as integration into international associations and infrastructures.
2. Introduction of modern approaches to the evaluation of scientific research activity in accordance with Open Science principles to increase the quality and impact of research (e.g., DORA - San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment, Leiden Manifesto for Research Metrics, ERAC - European Research Area and Innovation Committee Guidelines).
3. Ensuring that the results of scientific research comply with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), and that full and immediate open access is provided (subject to legitimate exceptions).
4. Establishment of a National Open Science Community for the introduction and monitoring of Open Science in Slovenia, as well as its integration into ERA and beyond.
5. Promoting the development of citizen science and public involvement in scientific research.
6. Promoting the development of a national scientific publishing system to operate according to the principles of Open Science.
These measures, which are recognised as essential for the development of Open Science in Slovenia, will be the basis for the Action Plan on Open Science which is in preparation.";;;;N/A

National INSPIRE point:
The Spatial Information Infrastructure Act (ZIPI), which transposed the INSPIRE Directive into Slovenian law, defines a national contact point for contacts with the European Commission in connection with the INSPIRE Directive and for the effective implementation of the spatial information infrastructure.

The ZIPI stipulates that the tasks of the national contact point are performed by the ministry responsible for geodetic activity, which in this case means the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning within which the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia operates.

The tasks of the national contact point it has determined are set out in Article 18 and it performs the following tasks:
maintains and maintains a list of spatial data sets,
keep more detailed descriptions of spatial data topics,
manages the geo-portal for spatial information,
manages and maintains the metadata information system,
takes care of ensuring the interoperability of spatial data sets and services,
prepares proposals for government operational programs referred to in Article 20 of this Act,
takes care of the implementation of the implementing rules of the INSPIRE Directive in the Republic of Slovenia,
prepares and complements the infrastructure strategy for spatial information,
prepares a program of activities and measures necessary to meet the requirements for the establishment of infrastructure for spatial information,
prepares reports on the provision of spatial information infrastructure for the European Commission.

Therefore, some public organizations, such as GURS (Surveying and Mapping Authority), have prepared an agreement on the use of access services in the form of SLA. The use of data has been monitored, systematically since 2005, also for electronic transmission and access services. Application monitoring is performed with the help of business analytics within the BI data warehouse and through web analytics at the portal level. With advanced users who have specific business requirements for the use of services and information in real time, they conclude simple mutual agreements in which mutual relations are defined.

Data Economy Under the Strategy for the Alps to Promote Competitiveness and New business in the Alpine Area
DEAS PROJECT
Although several local initiatives are already using OD/LOD in different sectors in the Alpine area, there is no uniform impact on the entire region, and practical solutions still need to be provided. The DEAS project aims to improve the value of using OD/LOD for public services and businesses and will focus on strategic sectors of the Alpine area, such as environment, tourism and mobility. With the DEAS project, we will encourage the public and private sectors to create new and user-oriented services.
The purpose of the DEAS project includes the following activities:
― digitization of public services,
― identification of open data and related open data with which we can develop new and more efficient
services,
― obtaining new data by installing different types of sensors,
― publishing on open data platforms,
― development of a data economy strategy.
MAIN OBJECTIVES AND ACTIVITIES
The purpose of the DEAS project is to increase the value of exploiting the available OD/LOD for innovations, increasing the Alpine area’s competitiveness and accelerating its digitalization. These activities will contribute to the fulfillment of the Alpine Strategy on the Data Economy and strengthen cooperation between public and private actors operating in the field of the Data Economy, especially with OD/LOD. The main objective is to exploit their potential for innovation and growth and thereby contribute to implementing S3 and related local development plans.

1. The present studyis based on the results of the target research project (CRP) Design of information solutions for decision-making about CAP (ITzaCAP) based on data. The purpose of CRP ITzaSKP was to encourage the opening of public administrative (micro) data in agriculture in Slovenia for as many purposes as possible, including or above all those that were not defined when the data was created. The project took place in the context of new social expectations and needs in the field of agriculture and in related fields and in the context of the possibility of using information technology. 

It was based on data science – the disciplines of social science and information science. In this way, it complemented other related projects, mostly in the field of agrarian economics, which pursued the goal of using data for a specific objective and/or in a specific area of agriculture. The project was financed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food (MKGP) and the Public Research Agency of the Republic of Slovenia.

2.2.4 Slovenia: Combining Open Data sources for public reuse - ERAR online application


Additional clarification:
In terms of data demand, there is a comparison with the FLINT project indicators which was focused on the FADN base, showed that it is possible in Slovenia with help of public administrative resources to provide (at least partial) microdata for as much as a third from around 30 economic ones (investments and insurance - based on measures, duration of farms, quality schemes, exposure to risks - non-agricultural activities), environmental (permanent grasslands, areas with ecological importance, potential calculations TGP with the help of standard factors) and social indicators (involvement in Education and Training).

On the basis of expressed needs and assessed possibilities for data analytics, we within the  framework of the experiment, obtained data from AKTRP for farms included in the system of agricultural subsidies (approximately 57,000 farms) for the period 2015-2019 (the current CAP cycle), which include up to about 400 variables on an annual basis. From MKGP (RKG) also obtained data on land (using) surfaces. We are data combined at the KMG unit level and performed some test tasks in the freely available and open source software environment (Orange). It was not the purpose of the experiment identifying individual cause-and-effect relationships and predicting, but also showing the potential of data for various analytical tasks in a more time-efficient way and generally accessible way and evaluating data systems from the point of view of data analytics based on practical IT problems that arose during the experiment appeared.

The experiment confirmed that the data has tremendous potential, but the obstacles are the knowledge of the structure of the resources and the necessary different knowledge and competences for meaningful use and interpretation. Obtaining, combining and editing data for individual purposes is due to its complex structure, fragmentation into areas and in time, lack of documentation, also in relation to quality and methods of use, various single-purpose systems, the absence of standard interfaces and others demanding in terms of time and human resources.
Several suggestions emerge from the conducted research, which are presented in bold in more detail in the conclusions of the chapters of the monograph, and we summarize them in the following Table 1 on page 277.

In the end, we can conclude that the conducted research complements existing research, which pointed out the non-targeting of measures in Slovenian agriculture and the problems access to individual data in a manner indicative of general public benefits and specific options for opening administrative data for various purposes use both in the social and technical-information sense.";These seem like examples of reuse cases, which are more suitable to Q41-Q44.

2) Guardian of Integrity https://varuhintegritete.transparency.si/about.php; With the help of the Guardian of Integrity, the public can gain additional insight into the impact of decisions made by political power holders in Slovenia on the basis of publicly available data. We refined the public sector data and made it more useful with the help of graphical representations. With the tool, users can search, sort and extract data in a simple way. With this, the Guardian of Integrity website contributes to increasing transparency and strengthening integrity, as well as improved access to decision-making procedures and public control over decision-makers due to potential conflicts of interest and undue influence.
We designed the Guardian of Integrity tool both to raise public awareness of the need to distinguish between legal and legitimate and illegal and unethical forms of influencing decisions made by political power holders, and as a need to raise awareness among these decision makers to consistently report lobbying contacts in accordance with the law and reject all attempts at unethical influence.
The purpose of the Guardian of Integrity tool is to use it to the greatest extent possible in the creation of journalistic contributions and stories in the field of political integrity, as this strengthens the political integrity of decision-makers and improves the public's information about influences on decision-making processes.

The register is of paramount importance as identifying a physical person, an individual that controls the company is one of preconditions to effectively combatting money laundering.
The register gathers data from 3 other registers: Business Register, Central Register of Inhabitants and Tax Register. 
What is publicly available are the following data: name and address of the owner and the way it controls the company. 
The law enforcement authorities can in addition access also data on the individual owner tax number, birth date and citizenship.";;;;15

At the same time, guidelines from state spatial acts, development needs of the municipality and protection requirements are taken into account.
Municipal spatial acts are an important basis for the rational and sustainable planning of all interventions in space in the municipality and for ensuring quality conditions for the life and work of its inhabitants. Municipal spatial acts are divided into strategic and executive acts. - https://www.gov.si/teme/obcinski-prostorski-akti/ ;

3) SME –test (Not for public use): The SME test application is a software solution that supports the process of assessing the impact of emerging regulations on the economy, especially on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
The SME test helps the draftsman to formulate draft regulations and policies. This can contribute to achieving the objectives of the drafters without unduly restricting or in any way reducing the opportunities for SMEs in the market and limiting the development of the business environment. The main advantages of the SME test are thus increasing the transparency of legislation, comparing different regulatory alternatives and preparing quality starting points for policy makers who choose the optimal measures to ensure the objectives of the legislation.";;;;15

1) Trends in regional development in Slovenia in the light of the goals of sustainable development (http://eurogeojournal.eu/articles/03_EJG_12_2_MALLY_036_051.pdf) 
This study was conducted for the whole of Slovenia, i.e., for all twelve statistical regions. Of central interest was the question of whether Slovenian regions are making long-term progress towards the goals of sustainable development, or whether they may even be backsliding relative to their starting position. The relative positions of Slovenian regions were investigated at three levels. On the first level, the positions of the regions are assessed in relation to the national average, based on particular aspects of development, which are covered by the selected 32 indicators of sustainable development in the economic, social and environmental areas. 
Social indicators: 
- Unemployed with uncompleted or completed primary school, 2019 (%) - Share of unemployed women, 2019 (%) 
- Population density, 2019 (people/km2) 
- Population growth index, 2015–2019 
- Aging index, 2019 
- Average age at death, 2019 (years) 
- At-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion rate, 2019 (%) - Usable floor area, 2018 (m2/capita) 
- Registered unemployment rate, 2019 (%) 
- Students, 2018/2019 (no. of students/1,000 people) - PC users, 2019 (% of households) 
- College degree holders (25–64 yrs), 2019 (%)

Additional clarification:
The research presented in the article was designed with this in mind and shows that based on changes in the values of individual indicators found, there has been an improvement in most of the studied socio-economic aspects of sustainable development in Slovenia in the last decade, but at the same time a worsening in most of the environmental aspects analyzed. This is yet another indicator that the socio-economic development of the country continues to take place at the expense of the environment: depletion of its resources and pollution. This worsens the long-term development prospects of the regions; hence the country will need to systematically address the problems exposed through well-thought-out measures.
As in previous periods, the assumption that in 2015–2019 the largest differences among the Slovenian regions are in the economic area and the smallest in the environmental area was confirmed. Compared to the period 2010–2014, the extent of interregional differences in the economic area has slightly decreased, while this cannot be quantifiably confirmed for differences in the environmental and social areas. The development divide between the more prosperous western part of the country and the lagging eastern part is also maintained; for the most part, the latter also has poorer prospects for implementing sustainable development in the future. These findings are

1) Trends in regional development in Slovenia in the light of the goals of sustainable development (http://eurogeojournal.eu/articles/03_EJG_12_2_MALLY_036_051.pdf)
Additional explanation for example 1. 
This study was conducted for the whole of Slovenia, i.e., for all twelve statistical regions. Of central interest was the question of whether Slovenian regions are making long-term progress towards the goals of sustainable development, or whether they may even be backsliding relative to their starting position. The relative positions of Slovenian regions were investigated at three levels. On the first level, the positions of the regions are assessed in relation to the national average, based on particular aspects of development, which are covered by the selected 32 indicators of sustainable development in the economic, social and environmental areas. 
They used this indicators: 
Environmental indicators: 
- Organically farmed land, 2020 (%) 
- Wooded areas, 2019 (m2/capita) 
- Road freight transport growth index, 2010–2019 
- Intensively farmed land, 2019 (m2/capita) 
- Households in polluted environment, 2019 (%, self-assessment) 
- Municipal waste, 2019 (kg/capita) 
- Natura 2000 sites, 2019 (%) 
- Water consumption, 2019 (m3/capita) 
- Average expenditure on environmental protection, 2017–2019 (% GDP) - Built-up areas, 2019 (%) 
- Treated wastewater, 2019 (%) 
- Housing with district heating in place, 2018 (%)

2) The influence of climate change on discharge fluctuations in Slovenian rivers (https://ojs.zrc-sazu.si/ags/article/view/9942)

Additional explanation for example 2. 
In the study, statistical trends in seasonal and annual mean, maximum, extreme and low discharge values were investigated using the Mann Kendall test. The results show a temporal and spatial variability of trends in discharge. In general, a decreasing trend in water quantities in the rivers was observed. However, results at some gauging stations indicate statistically significant increasing trends, especially formaximum and extreme discharges. Additional analyses show that the discharge trends depend on the location of the gauging station.

The purpose of the study is to determine the advantages and disadvantages of Ljubljana in the field of sustainability with the help of the Green Destination Standard, which are used in the Green Scheme of Slovenian tourism, and to make suggestions for improving this area. For the purpose of the study, I set out to examine the Green Destination Standards, which destinations take into account when introducing sustainable tourism, and based on these to get the advantages and disadvantages of Ljubljana as a sustainable destination and thus formulate suitable proposals for improvement. 

4) Opening data in Slovenian agriculture for fact-based decision-making
https://www.fdv.uni-lj.si/docs/default-source/zalozba/acmo-22-21-12-2021.pdf?sfvrsn=2
The present monograph is based on the results of the target research project (CRP) Design of information solutions for decision-making about CAP (ITzaCAP) based on data. The purpose of CRP ITzaSKP was to encourage the opening of public administrative (micro)data in agriculture in Slovenia for as many purposes as possible, including or especially those that were not defined when the data was created. The project took place in the context of new social expectations and needs in the field of agriculture and in related fields and in the context of the possibility of using information technology.

Additional explanation for example 4.  
The study was made on the basis of existing data, and among other things, it also prepared certain recommendations regarding the use of data for the field of nature protection as part of agricultural policy, as one of the important parts of biodiversity and solving environmental challenges. All recommendations are also based on existing open data.

Additional clarification:
1)	Trends in regional development in Slovenia in the light of the goals of sustainable development: 
The research presented in the article was designed with this in mind and shows that based on changes in the values of individual indicators found, there has been an improvement in most of the studied socio-economic aspects of sustainable development in Slovenia in the last decade, but at the same time a worsening in most of the environmental aspects analyzed. This is yet another indicator that the socio-economic development of the country continues to take place at the expense of the environment: depletion of its resources and pollution. This worsens the long-term development prospects of the regions; hence the country will need to systematically address the problems exposed through well-thought-out measures. As in previous periods, the assumption that in 2015–2019 the largest differences among the Slovenian regions are in the economic area and the smallest in the environmental area was confirmed. Compared to the period 2010–2014, the extent of interregional differences in the economic area has slightly decreased, while this cannot be quantifiably confirmed for differences in the environmental and social areas. The development divide between the more prosperous western part of the country and the lagging eastern part is also maintained; for the most part, the latter also has poorer prospects for implementing sustainable development in the future. These findings are therefore unfavorable both from the standpoint of achieving more balanced regional development and from the standpoint of achieving the goals of sustainable development, both of which are among Slovenia’s strategic goals.
2)	The influence of climate change on discharge fluctuations in Slovenian rivers:
The results of the study show that climate variability during the considered period (1961–2013) influences the temporal and spatial variability of discharges and associated floods and droughts in Slovenia. In general, a decrease in water quantities in the rivers was observed. Similar conclusions were drawn also by Frantar, Kobold and Ulaga (2008) using the data for the whole observation period until 2005. Thus, it seems that similar trends continue also a decade later. Mean annual discharges are decreasing at all stations considered, statistically significant at most of them. Furthermore, the rivers of the Adriatic catchment demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in mean discharges in the summer season and the rivers of the Black Sea catchment in the summer and spring sea-sons. On the other hand, the maximum mean daily discharges do not show such uniform trends as the mean discharges as some gauging stations exhibit statistically significant trends in annual maximum dis-charge series. However, despite the fact that the results of the trends of the maximum annual discharge indicate regional differences, a predominantly decreasing trend was observed. The rivers of the Adriatic Sea catchment mostly demonstrate a statistically significant decreasing trend in the maximum discharges in the spring and summer seasons, while the rivers of the Black Sea catchment do not show uniform trends. The extreme annual discharge values also do not show a uniform trend; however, even more gauging stations show a statistically increasing trend compared to the trends in maximum discharges. Most of them are in the Ljubljanica and the Krka River catchments. Furthermore, the results of the trend analysis of low discharges demonstrate statistically significant decrease for the rivers of the Black Sea catchment, while for the rivers of the Adriatic Sea catchment some stations do not show statistically significant changes. Low discharges decrease in summer at most stations, while in some catchments they also decrease in autumn and spring. The results show that the discharge trends depend to some extent on the location of the gauging station. This was to be expected due to the great climatic and landscape diversity in Slovenia. The findings of the study related to the trends of different types of discharge data series should be taken into account in practice, e.g. for effective water management, flood protection, granting permits for water abstraction, designing of irrigation systems.
3)	Green scheme of Slovenian tourism: the case of Ljubljana:
In the final assignment, the aim was to determine the strengths and weaknesses of Ljubljana in the field of sustainability with the help of the Green Destination Standard, which are used in the Green Scheme of Slovenian tourism, and to make suggestions for improving this area. Therefore, the basic concepts of sustainable tourism, environmental labeling and the Green Scheme of Slovenian tourism were described in more detail in the theoretical part.

Since descriptive methods were used throughout the study, the Green Destination Standard was used for the purposes of the empirical work. First, the topics, subtopics and indicators that are used in the Green Destination Standard were examined, so that the display had a better idea of which data and from which areas are needed for the analysis of Ljubljana in the field of sustainability. The open data used for each theme of the Green Destination Standard is of a secondary nature and has already been obtained. With the help of this data, Ljubljana's strengths, and weaknesses in the field of sustainability were revealed, and proposals for improvement were prepared on the basis of this.
4)	In terms of data demand, there is a comparison with the FLINT project indicators which was focused on the FADN base, showed that it is possible in Slovenia with help of public administrative resources to provide (at least partial) microdata for as much as a third from around 30 economic ones (investments and insurance - based on measures, duration of farms, quality schemes, exposure to risks - non-agricultural activities), environmental (permanent grasslands, areas with ecological importance, potential calculations TGP with the help of standard factors) and social indicators (involvement in Education and Training). 

Based on expressed needs and assessed possibilities for data analytics, we within the framework of the experiment, obtained data from AKTRP for farms included in the system of agricultural subsidies (approximately 57,000 farms) for the period 2015-2019 (the current CAP cycle), which include up to about 400 variables on an annual basis. From MKGP (RKG) also obtained data on land (using) surfaces. We are data combined at the KMG unit level and performed some test tasks in the freely available and open-source software environment (Orange). It was not the purpose of the experiment identifying individual cause-and-effect relationships and predicting, but also showing the potential of data for various analytical tasks in a more time-efficient way and generally accessible way and evaluating data systems from the point of view of data analytics based on practical IT problems that arose during the experiment appeared. 
The experiment confirmed that the data has tremendous potential, but the obstacles are the knowledge of the structure of the resources and the necessary different knowledge and competences for meaningful use and interpretation. Obtaining, combining, and editing data for individual purposes is due to its complex structure, fragmentation into areas and in time, lack of documentation, also in relation to quality and methods of use, various single-purpose systems, the absence of standard interfaces and others demanding in terms of time and human resources. 
Several suggestions emerge from the conducted research, which are presented in bold in more detail in the conclusions of the chapters of the monograph, and we summarize them in the following Table 1 on page 277. 
In the end, we can conclude that the conducted research complements existing research, which pointed out the non-targeting of measures in Slovenian agriculture and the problems access to individual data in a manner indicative of public benefits and specific options for opening administrative data for various purposes use both in the social and technical-information sense.";Please descibe the content of the reprots and how the show impact created by open data relating to environmental challenges;Thank you for the updated answer.
