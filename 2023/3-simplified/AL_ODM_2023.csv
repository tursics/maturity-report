https://ogp.gov.al/en/faqe/misioni-strategjia - The OGP's vision in Albania is for the government to become more stable, transparent and accountable to their citizens, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of governance and the quality of the services the citizens receive. This will require a change in norms and culture to ensure sincere dialogue and cooperation between governments and civil society.

OGP aims to support the government and civil society reformers by raising the open government at the highest levels of political discourse, providing 'overlay' for difficult reforms and creating a supportive community of reformers of a similar mind from countries around the world .

Now that OGP has been established and has grown significantly, our main objective in the next two years is to make sure that real change takes place on the ground in most OGP countries and that this change is benefiting the citizens. There are three main ways for OGPs to help secure the right conditions for countries to provide ambitious open government reform:

1) Maintain high-level political leadership and OGP engagement among participating countries

2) Support internal reforms with technical expertise and inspiration

3) Encourage greater OGP engagement from a diverse group of citizens and civil society organizations

In addition, the OGP Independent Reporting Mechanism requires:

4) Ensure that countries are held accountable to make progress towards achieving their commitments to OGP";"Please highlight how the strategy relates to Open Data. Only ""open government"" is mentioned.";;;30

● anti-corruption & beneficial owners;
● access to justice;
● digital transformation and innovation;
● fiscal transparency;
● public services;
● inclusiveness;
● the right to information, consultation and regulatory impact assessment;
● open parliament.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
 Anti-corruption. Awareness and education for anti-corruption mechanisms are two areas provided in the Cross-Cutting Strategy Anti-Corruption, 2015-2023 and its action plans. Specifically, measures are provided in the function of raising awareness and education of the general public on the consequences of corruption, promoting the public and increasing confidence in anti -corruption mechanisms, as well as increasing civil society involvement in these initiatives. The measures provided in the ISAC 2015-2020 and the Action Plan in force of 2020-2023 have influenced the creation of a climate of cooperation between the public and public institutions. Qualitative and efficient mechanisms for prevention and awareness of corruption have been created, there is good cooperation but more frequency is required.
The Ministry of Justice has a communication and visibility strategy, and an annual action plan with activities and initiatives with CSOs and interest groups. Annual, regular editions of the Week of Integrity since 2020, a close collaboration with business, the CSO and the Academy are good evidence but also to be replicated throughout the year. Continuing work by intensifying efforts to raise public awareness and education will create appropriate conditions for a society aware of the danger of corruption and with high confidence in public institutions, improving the public perception of corruption, not only by Local and regional and international organizations such as Transparency International.                                                                                                                                                                                                            Access to Justice: This component has found wide scope by being materialized and strongly related to the
implementation of the justice reform, the Crosscutting Justice Strategy (CSJS), the Crosscutting Strategy for Juvenile Justice (CSJJ), the Strategy for Public Legal Education(SPLE), and other measures taken by the Government in fulfillment of its mission
for an open, transparent and accountable governance/policy. With the initiation of the Justice Reform, a deep reform that is affecting in its entirety every element of the current justice system, a reformation of the legal aid system was also initiated, offering a new spirit, in sync with the requirements and legislation of the European Union and as a facilitating mechanism used to increase access to justice for groups who do not have the financial means to pay legal fees to the bodies/courts and at the same time to enable legal
counseling or protection. Free legal aid programs aim to bring the justice system closer to the needs of citizens. For this reason, this component is focused on providing effective but also accessible and affordable legal remedies for solving problems.                                          Fiscal Transparency: The public finance management reform continues to be a priority of the Albanian government not only as one of the preconditions for accession to the European Union under public administration reform (PAR), but also as part of the Open Government Partnership aims at supporting a more developed economy with better services to citizens. Satisfactory progress in the implementation of reforms to improve public financial management. Referring to the 2021 SIGMA monitoring report1, the overall trajectory for Albania in PFM is upwards, from 2.8 in 2017 to 3.3 in 2021, and is above the regional average of 3.1. Compared to the regional average, performance is similar or stronger in each indicator in the PFM domain, except for the functioning of internal audit (IA). Most pronounced is the strong performance in the domains of public procurement and the foundations for the functioning of Financial Management Control (FMC), IA and external audit.                                                                                                                                        PROMOTION OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND INNOVATION: E-Albania acts as a front-end point for government institutions to deliver their services, thusoperating as a one stop single access point to citizens on obtaining online government services,
as well as information on public services 24/7. By offering more than 1200 electronic services, the portal has improved the accessibility of information about public services, the level of public awareness about the procedures of public service delivery, and has most importantly acted as a robust catalyst in decreasing queues in public agencies’ receptions, reducing
corruption and bureaucracy, providing citizen equality, decreasing service obtainment time and promoting government transparency.
All of 1227 e-services offered on the portal are dedicated to a wide range of users, from unemployed citizens, drivers, property owners, pupils, the elderly, Albanians living abroad, businesses, civic employees etc. These services are also classified in categories (health,
economy, education, etc.) and are also searchable through the search bar.

This helps many people, like researchers, government workers, business owners, and regular people, find the information they need. We're teaming up with different parts of the government and organizations to make sure we're always getting new and useful data. By doing this, we want our portal to be the best place to find lots of different information.
Milestone 2: Raising awareness and promoting usage through multiple communication channels.At the same time, we know that having data available is important, but it's also important that people know about it and know how to use it. We're using many different ways to tell people about the data we have. We're using social media, online classes, workshops, and information campaigns to reach different groups of people. We want everyone to know what they can do with the data we share and how it can help them. We also want people to tell us what they think so we can make the data even better.
In short, we're taking these two steps to make sure more people can get data easily and use it to make informed decisions.

On the implementation of this decision NAIS has invested and is currently working on building new systems, the digitization of physical archives, increasing the number of systems connected to the Governmental Interoperability Platform, the exchange of data between them, improving electronic services of the e-Albania governmental portal, physical infrastructure, capacity building dedicated to electronic archives, as well as equipping all actors with digital signatures / seal in order to anticipate and involve all steps and links in this process. NAIS is also the state owner of the systems under the Council of Ministers responsibility, but the owner of the data are the institutions themselves. In this regard, NAIS works with them to define the open data that could be published automatically from their electronic systems and technically makes sure the webservices exposing the data are established.";Please be more specific about the activities assisting the publication of real-time and/or dynamic data.;Thank you for the additional information.

This prevented us from gathering feedback on whether these users accessed fee-based datasets elsewhere.
