Ukraine is one of the ten countries in the world in terms of garbage production. According to various estimates, there are between 10,000 and more than 26,000 natural dumps in the country. Through the Ecomap service from the Ministry of Environment, citizens can apply for illegal landfills to eliminate them. The map also includes data on legal landfills, as well as the ability to monitor hazardous waste management sites. Ecomapa https://ecomapa.gov.ua/ is an interactive electronic catalog of legal landfills and a tool for monitoring illegal landfills and hazardous waste management sites. Thanks to him, it was possible to combine public and open data on landfills in Ukraine, as well as provide citizens with a convenient tool for monitoring hazardous waste management sites. The user can quickly and easily get information about the licensee's name, the type of hazardous waste handled by the licensee (eg collection, storage, transportation of hazardous waste), the list of waste types, the date of issue and the current status of the license.
Creating a map allowed:
For the first time, develop a convenient and effective channel for citizens to complain about landfills.
Any citizen, noticing a landfill, can take a photo of it and send a photo, adding a location, through the mobile application ""Ecomapa"" or through the website ecomapa.gov.ua. Next, the operator of the contact center of the Ministry of Environment considers the appeal and submits it for execution to the relevant regional state administration, which sends a request to the district administration to liquidate the landfill and monitors the implementation. The applicant monitors the status of his application in the application or on the website and finally confirms or does not confirm its implementation. Appeals are considered in accordance with the Law of Ukraine ""On Citizens' Appeals"" and processed within a month from the date of receipt.
Collect an array of data on landfills that could not be otherwise published.
Thanks to the service it became possible to estimate the scale and territorial concentration of natural landfills. According to the developers of the service, about 95% of all appeals indicate the actual problem objects.
In addition to appeals, the map displays four layers of other data:
1) Register of waste disposal sites (legal landfills);
2) Register of natural landfill sites (maintained by some regions in Ukraine);
3) Recycling points;

Every year in Ukraine there are about 40 thousand fires in the ecosystems of Ukraine. About 80% of seasonal fires in agricultural fields are repeated in the areas of the same owners / users. Project ""Don't burn - compost!"" helps communities address the burning of stubble, fallen leaves, organic and other garden and agricultural waste. The introduction of composting practices contributes to improving air quality, while helping to address environmental challenges and improving the situation with the disposal of organic waste in local communities.

The project is based on two tasks: to assess the depth, scale and causes of the combustion problem and to stimulate the search for solutions to this problem.

Responce to reviewer:
Local governments analyze open data on fires within the citty/village. It was found that most of the fires happen on the same parts of the territory of the community. Most
burning of garden waste (fallen leaves, branches) and residues on agricultural fields are relevant types of arson. For the future, local governments know: there is a risk zone.
Thanks to geoanalytics based on open data, some local governments identified the ""firebugs"" with who it is necessary to carry out outreach work, and fire response plans are being developed, in particular planning

Direct economic impacts include the economic value created by enterprises that provide services using open data, as well as the corresponding employment. Employment is considered to have a direct economic impact if the organization bases its business or activities on open data (for example, a startup that would not be able to operate without open data, or a civil servant working with a national portal).The creation of economic value in the macroeconomic sense involves the creation of gross value added. The latter includes three components: gross profit of the enterprise, wages of employees and taxes paid on products and taxes related to production (excluding subsidies). In other words, the business generates certain profits for its investors, employees and the state. Open data companies, like any business, also create gross value added - it is a direct economic contribution of such companies. https://kse.ua/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Open-data-methodology-2021-11-04.pdf

Responce to reviewer:
Report on Economic Impact of Open Data in Ukraine has been developed (https://tapas.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Economic-impact_report.pdf).
The report analyzed three key indicators: 1) the impact of open data on the Ukrainian economy; 2) the number of jobs related to open data in the country; and 3) the sectors of the Ukrainian economy that benefit the most from open data. 
The information presented in the report is based on the pace of economic development and advancement in the Ukrainian open data sphere until Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022. 
One of its findings was that open data contributed between 0.62-1.19% of Ukraine’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020. 
The open data sphere could contribute between 0.78-2.08% to Ukraine’s economy i.e., UAH 49.9 billion ($167 million) by 2025 through a combination of direct and indirect benefits. 
The research also found that the number of Ukrainians working directly with open data is between 4,400 - 6,700. In 2025, somewhere between 23,600 to 50,800 people could be working with open data. 
Top sectors working with open data in Ukraine include: IT and telecommunications; scientific and technical activities; public administration; real estate, transportation; and postal and courier services. This was TAPAS’ second study on the impact of open data on Ukraine’s economy.";"The economic impact is hereby defined as the beneficial effect of the use of open data on three indicators of economic growth:

According to the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, in 2020 there were about 7.5 million full-time employees in Ukraine. As Ukraine is part of a cluster of ""fast-growing countries"", the share of direct employment related to open data is about 0.09% of all employees. Accordingly, according to the implementation of the Optimistic Scenario, direct employment in the field of open data is 6.7 thousand people. If employment grew in line with the growth of the general open data market, then in the Conservative scenario, direct employment is 4.4 thousand people.
However, in addition to direct employment, open data also provide indirect employment. According to research by Shakespeare and Vickery, the indirect open data market is 250-278% of the direct market. Given the average value of these studies, the indirect employment associated with open data is 11.5-7.8 thousand people.YouControl https://youcontrol.com.ua/en/ - Analytical system for compliance, market analysis, business intelligence and investigations.
The idea of a business intelligence service arose from the need for a retail business. There was a lack of automated service in an area where thousands of counterparties needed to be tested for reliability.
Initially, a search was developed and implemented in the State Registration Bulletin. Soon 10 more registers were added to YouControl. More than 60 official sources are currently connected.
YouControl functionality allows you to solve the following tasks:
Monitoring of official data of contractors based on information from open data
Solutions in the field of corporate economic and information security
Competitive intelligence, business analytics, compliance
Analysis of declarations and public procurement.
Opendatabot https://opendatabot.ua/en  - Service for monitoring the registration data of Ukrainian companies and the court register to protect against raids and control of counterparties.
The idea to create the service arose in 2013, when the own IT company of future developers faced a raider capture. Basically, all seizures take place according to one scheme - change of founders and directors on forged documents, withdrawal of assets from the company and subsequent bankruptcy. A chatbot could be the fastest way to tell an entrepreneur that something is going on with his assets
In April 2016, a register of Ukrainian companies and entrepreneurs was published on the open data portal. Then the initiators of the project realized that it could be a tool to protect business. In 3 days the first version of the bot for Telegram was made.

Response to reviewer:
Whereas YouControl helps to provide due diligence it uses Open Data as a main source of information, for e.g. Unified Register of Legal Entities (now access to the Register is limited due to security measures), financial reports of enterprises, Register of Court Decisions etc.

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe how.";yes;"The Ministry of Digital transformation as the owner of the National open data portal, has several tools for the monitoring of the datasets quality published by dataproviders on the portal. In fact, it consists of several levels of verification, monitoring and re-monitoring.
1. Before all datasets are published, they are moderated - the authorized person checks the correct completion of the ""dataset`s passport"" and metadata compliance with approved standards.
2. In the second stage, the portal automatically checks the data set files for logical /syntactic/semantic errors (Applies to files published in .xls(x), .xml, .json formats)
Only if two checks (manual and automatic) successfully passed dataset is published on the portal.
3. The Ministry shall continuously monitor already published datasets for their timely updating and updating in accordance with the approved requirements (standards). This applies to both the dataset`s metadata and the files that contain the information.
In the event that the inspection finds out that the dataset no longer meets the established requirements (standards) for the publication, the dataprovider of such dataset receives a message requesting to correct errors, and the dataset itself is temporarily removed from public access.
This format of monitoring and checking the quality of datasets and metadata on the portal has been operating for 4 years in a row and is constantly being improved, which has significantly improved the quality of datasets on the portal";;;;;15
