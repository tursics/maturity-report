P1;"Is there a national open data policy in your country and, if your country is an EU Member State, does this include a national legislation for the transposition of the Open Data Directive?

For Explanation:
* If yes, please provide (1) the URL and (2) title of the policy document and (3) briefly describe.
* If ‘other’, please provide (1) a brief explanation to support your answer choice and (2) provide the URL and indicate the policy section which explicitly references open data.";yes;"Yes, there is an open data law at federal level. In July 2017, Section 12a of the E-Government Act (EGovG) entered into force (First Open Data Act), which for the first time created a legal basis for the mandatory provision of open administrative data by federal authorities. The Second Open Data Act, which entered into force in July 2021, further adapted the content of the existing obligations under Section 12a of the EGovG and extended them to the entire federal administration.

The Data Use Act (DNG) which also entered into force on 23 July 2021 aims to modernise and replace the Information Re-Use Act (IWG). In order to improve the usability of data, open data will need to be used in machine-readable formats. In addition, the DNG stimulates open data initiatives beyond the boundaries of the federal administration and establishes the principle of ‘open by default’ also for the use of data by the Länder, municipalities and public undertakings in the areas of water, transport and energy supply. The DNG also transposes EU Directive 2019/1024 (Open Data and Public Sector Information-Directive), which was recast in 2019.

The Federal Government’s Open Data Strategy, adopted on 6 July 2021, provides a framework for action to improve the Federal Open Data Ecosystem. The Federal Government’s data strategy forms the overarching data policy framework for the Open Data Strategy. Over a period of five years, the Open Data Strategy covers three areas of action, with a total of 68 implementation measures taken by different federal ministries and authorities. The three strands of action include improving the provision of data and developing data infrastructures, increasing innovative, public-interest and responsible use of data, and promoting data literacy and a data culture to increase the quality and usability of data provided. The implementation of the Open Data Strategy is accompanied by continuous monitoring.";Confirm;;;;;;;;

For an example of an open data policy see: https://www.landesrecht.rlp.de/bsrp/document/jlr-TranspGRPrahmen 
The Rhineland-Palatinate State Transparency Act (LTranspG) came into force on January 1, 2016. It regulates access to “information”, this means official information and environmental information. The law provides for an application procedure according to which anyone can request access to information present from any so-called transparency-obligated body (this includes all Rhineland-Palatinate authorities, insofar as they carry out administrative activities). Furthermore, the law regulates that the information defined in a definite list in § 7 para. 1 and 2 LTranspG must be published proactively (officially, without having to submit an application) by the bodies subject to transparency obligations. The place of publication is an electronic platform, the so-called transparency platform, provided by the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate. In addition to the Transparency Act the government of Rhineland-Palatinate is planning on initiating an open data policy similar to the one at federal level  in order to ensure that even more government data is available to the public free of charge and in a standardized, machine-readable form. In this context, the adoption of an open data strategy is also envisaged.

Furthermore, the Federal German government funds the re-use of Open Data by the C opernicus Project amount of total funding to be handed in in later progress.

The data strategy and also the open data strategy of the government outline that the state should become the frontrunner / leader in the field of data usage and provision. This includes increasing the provision of open data; data literacy and using the data for policy making (data driven government).

P10-a;"Does the national strategy/policy mandate carrying out and maintaining a data inventory by public bodies, whether at national or local level?

For Explanation:
* If yes, please briefly specify.";yes;"Regarding the national level:
The data strategy contains several measures specifing a data inventory, e.g.:
- Verwaltungsdateninformationsplattform (VIP); published by the Federal statistical office: https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Staat/Buerokratiekosten/VIP/vip.html
- Datenatlas (this includes an inventory analysis of all the administration’s data), see:
https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1845634/0bab2b7d06c82f45361620f0c22891a2/datenstrategie-der-bundesregierung-download-bpa-data.pdf?download=1 (page 50 and 88)

- A measure of the Open Data Strategy: the Competence Center Open Data (CCOD) at the Federal Office of Administration has developed a prototype of a ""theme catalogue"" of open data. (https://opendatabund.github.io/themenkataloge/)

Regarding the regional / communal level:
Due to consitutional restrictions in Germany owing to Germany's Federal structure (Bund on the national level and the 16 Länder), the national government cannot directly mandate the federal states (Länder) or communes/cities and their respective public bodies to maintain a data inventory. However, within the limits of the German constitution, the national government has issued a law that specifies which data that must be published as open data (§12a). 
This is due to constitutional restraints (verfassungsrechtliche Hürden) but incentives were used e.g. in programmes to support local and regional initiatives (Modellkommunen/ Model Municipalities BMI) as well as dialogue formats with all regions and local authorities. Link: https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/themen/moderne-verwaltung/open-government/modellkommune/modellkommune-node.html
Based on the results of the project ""Modellkommune"", see also the current initiative of the regional open government laboratories:
https://open-government-kommunen.de/

Response to r1: The overarching Topic Page (main page) is better suited here. This page summarises all the main findings of the regional open government laboratory initiative, to which we refer in our reply.";Complement;Yes;"There is currently no obligation on federal level to create a data catalogue on a legal basis or on the basis of the various strategies in the field of data/open data.

In fact, such an obligation is currently being considered for a planned transparency law (on federal level). However, the discussion process itself has not yet started and therefore no decisions have been made yet.

In addition, there are datasets that require at least certain requirements (examples at federal level):
- Verwaltungsdateninformationsplattform (VIP); published by the Federal statistical office: https://www.verwaltungsdaten-informationsplattform.de/DE/Home/home_node.html
- Datenatlas (this includes an inventory analysis of all the administration’s data), see:
https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1845634/0bab2b7d06c82f45361620f0c22891a2/datenstrategie-der-bundesregierung-download-bpa-data.pdf?download=1 (page 50 and 88)

P10-b;"Do these data inventories include the data collected by public bodies that cannot be published as open data (e.g. in relation to the EU Data Governance Act (EU) 2022/868)? 

For Explanation:
* If yes, please briefly specify.";yes;"Yes, the Verwaltungsdateninformationsplattform (VIP, see above) specifies identifying (but not publishing) all metadata from registers, which by their nature as personal data do not entail any open data.
The German Open Data Law (§12a EGovG) currently specifies, which data cannot be published as open data. This data for instance includes individual-level personal data, research data, as well as data thay may put Germany's national security at risk. 

Furthermore the second Open Data Act (in force since 07/2021) includes a specific regime for research data requiring publication in certain cases";Complement;Yes;"As noted above, there is no legal obligation to create data catalogues. Nevertheless, for example, the Administrative Data Information Platform (VIP, see above) specifies the identification (but not the publication) of all metadata from registers which, by their nature, do not contain open data as personal data.
The German Open Data Act (§12a EGovG) currently determines which data may not be published as Open Data. These data include, for example, personal data at an individual level, research data and data that may jeopardise the national security of Germany.

90-99%. We have an open data portal for almost every federal state in Germany. The large (but also smaller) cities operate their own open data portal. In addition, there are various thematic data portals, such as for traffic data and geodata. All these data portals are linked together in a large network or tree and harvest each other. At the end is GovData, which harvests almost all of the metadata from sub-portals. Only a small amount of data is entered directly into GovData by hand.";;;;;;
Q3;"What is the average delay from the moment the metadata describing a dataset is updated at the source, and the moment the change is visible on the portal?

For Explanation:
* Please explain the approach for updating metadata in a timely manner";new question;new question;Change;Within one week;"GovData: On average, the metadata is updated after 2 days. If metadata is changed manually directly in the GovData portal, the changes are visible immediately. If a dataset is changed in the geoportal of a city, the city harvests its geoportal, the city may be harvested by the portal of the district, which in turn is harvested by the federal state, which is harvested by GovData. This chain can result in a delay of several days when updating the data.

Follow up: confirmation";;;;;;
Q4;"Do you undertake efforts to ensure that published data covers the full period from when it was first published until today, for example,the complete time series?

For Explanation:
* If yes, please explain the measures in place to ensure complete series of datasets";new question;new question;Change;Yes;"GovData: Until recently, it was not possible to mark up data series in the metadata. Therefore, data series were created as differently as possible in the past. The local sub-portals all have their own strategy for dealing with this. With the introduction of DCAT-AP.de 3.0, an example of a correct data series is planned. Based on this, we could work towards harmonization.

Follow up: Yes the new DCAT-AP.de version make it possible to mark dataset series correctly and unique. Today we do not measure this aspect because there is no standardized way and 4+ ways used to mark dataseries.";;;;;;
Q5;"Have you implemented the DCAT-AP High Value Datasets (semiceu.github.io) tag to denote the High-Value Datasets in your (national) open data portal(s)?

GovData: 
We are proud to have been the second state to correctly transfer the high-value datasets award to the European data portal. In order to do this successfully, we had to extend CKAN so that HVD data could be imported into a CKAN system and then exported. Our changes have been transferred to the official repo according to the open source rules. For the geodata, we had to adapt the converter of the geo-ISO data. A lengthy coordination process with and within the geo-community was necessary beforehand. Please also refer to the answer to question PT22.";;;;;;
Q6;"Besides the DCAT-AP tag mentioned above, have you implemented any other measures to ensure that high-value datasets ((EU) 2023/138) are interoperable with datasets of other country?

For Explanation:
* If yes, please specify how and highlight challenges if any.
* If you are an EFTA or a candidate country to the EU, please select 'not applicable'.";new question;new question;Change;No;"GovData: In some cases, the specialist communities themselves ensure that the individual data records are compatible. Two specialist areas are cited as examples. The geodata are collected in the federal states and, thanks to established structures, they can be harmonized and offered as a common dataset for the whole of Germany. The INSPIRE specifications mean that the datasets are comparable throughout Europe. The weather data is not only compatible within Europe but is also internationally interoperable thanks to its standardization.

Follow up: The correct answer is still 'no'. INSPIRE and weather data are older than HVD. So we have interoperable datasets but we do no special activities for HVD datasets that there are interoperable with other countries";;;;;;

* If applicable, please provide the URL to the documentation of the national DCAT-AP extension.";yes;"DCAT-AP.de is only complement to DCAT-AP, so it is completely conforming to DCAT-AP. The complement to DCAT-AP are necessary to depict German peculiarities.
https://www.dcat-ap.de/ // R2: For an exact explanation, we would have to answer the question separately.

In short, there are two legally different approaches between the CC BY 4.0 licence and the German data licence. CC BY focuses on material property law, while the German variant classifies the licensing of (official) datasets as a dedication/administrative act. This results in a different legal assessment. In addition, there are aspects from the regulations in Germany regarding general terms and conditions (GTC) in the context of civil law.

So there is a subtle legal distinction behind the data licence - a ""German peculiarity"". :-)

- Open data is a key aspect of the mFUND funding program. Innovation projects are supported financially that make their project results and research data available as open data at the latest after the project has ended. BMVI's open data portal mCLOUD (https://mcloud.de/) is the primary repository for the publication of open data for mFUND projects. The scope of the planned open data provision already plays a decisive role in the assessment of the submitted project proposals.
- A number of federal agencies have implented Open Data in all data relevant processes and in their strategic orientation (change management), e.g. BAW, BSH, DWD.
- The study  ""Kommunales Open Government. Gebrauchsanleitung für eine Utopie"" published by the  Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community moreover presents several concrete expectations of positive impact thanks to open government data (URL: https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/veroeffentlichungen/themen/moderne-verwaltung/leitfaden-modellkommune-open-govt.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1) 
-  In the course of the Ministry's project ""Modellkomune Open Government"", eight impact dimensions of openness and nine expected impacts for public bodies were identified (see pp. 61 & p. 65, URL:  https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/veroeffentlichungen/themen/moderne-verwaltung/projektbericht-modellkommune-open-government.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2)

For Explanation:
* If yes, please briefly describe the key points of this methodology.";yes;"As impact is defined in different ways (see Q33 above), there are different methodologies used on the national, regional, local and project-level. 
- On the national level, the implementation and corresponding impact of the open data law is measured through an online questionnaire and writing of a bi-annual ""Fortschrittsbericht"" (Progress report). See the first one and also the results of the mearung here: https://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/19/141/1914140.pdf

- The State (Land) NRW has developed a through evaluation for its overall open government strategy, which includes measuring its open-data-goals and the associated impact (URL: 
https://www-open-nrw.prod-drupal.nrw.de/system/files/media/document/file/opennrwt1web.pdf) 
- The project ""Modellkomune Open Government"" published an accompanying guidebook that specifies ""expectations"" associated with openness and concrete steps to achieve them. These are at the same time the basis for impact evaluation (URL: https://open-government-kommunen.de/goto.php?target=file_425_download&client_id=civitalis) 
- the Open Data Impact Award of the Stifterverband suggests that ""impact"" of open data in research means that the data has successfully been implemented in another societal field (creating an added value for society, openly available for a large number of users) (URL: https://www.stifterverband.org/innosci/open-data-impact-award)

For Explanation:
* If yes, please provide an example
* If possible, URLs to such projects and collaborations.";yes;"Yes, see some examples below:
- the FU Berlin Open Acccess Initiative: https://www.fu-berlin.de/sites/open_access/akteure/oa-policy

- there is funding and other activities to promote research data management with the goal to make this high quality data accessible through the FAIR-principles for the benefit of science, business and civil society.

- In the mFUND program there are a number of projects that emerge from civil society engagement. One example is the project miki (""mobil im Kiez"", https://www.bmvi.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/miki.html), that aims to develop solutions for the navigation and orientation of people with reduced mobility under participation of civil society engagement. In total there are 15 mFUND-projects under participation of civil society organizations that use open data and/ or create open data.

- OParl is an initiative to promote the openness of parliamentary information systems at municipal level in Germany, see: https://oparl.org/

- There are currently 34 so called ""OK Labs"" all over germany which operate under the leadership of Code for Germany. These Labs work with open data on a daily basis and create several projects, applications and use cases. See an overview of the labs here:

The BMDV research program mFUND explicitly requests the reuse and/or provision of open data for innovative mobility projects. Here are three examples of funded projects within the mFUND program:
FixMyCity (https://www.fixmycity.de) provides a platform and tools for the planning of bicycle infrastructure. It is based on the mFUND project FixmyBerlin (https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/fixmyberlin.html?nn=12830). The tool is open to use under (https://fixmyberlin.de/planungen), helping to improve such infrastructure based on data provided by citizens.
RailBench (https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Artikel/DG/mfund-projekte/rail-bench.html) is a currently running mFUND project that is developing a benchmark suite for rail transport automation and will be available under an open license. It's based on the KITTI benchmark suite, and data is provided by Deutsche Bahn and the German Centre for Rail Traffic Research (DZSF). Data can be found here: https://data.fid-move.de/dataset/osdar23.
Wheelmap (https://wheelmap.org/search) is a platform that shows data on accessibility in public spaces and public transport, as well as other locations such as hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, etc. It is based on a selection of projects funded within the mFUND program (https://sor.bz/FZ6U7).
