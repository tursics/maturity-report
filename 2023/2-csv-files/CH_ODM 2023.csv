;"Please note that this section differentiates between open data policy and open data strategy. Policy here refers to all principles/initiatives set out to achieve the goals established by the Open Data Directive, including specific national legislation put in place to transpose the EU law. With strategy, on the other hand, we define a document outlining the concrete vision, mission, objectives, measures to be implemented, timeline and responsible. An open data strategy would ideally include information on the open data governance structure and operating model.

;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;435
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

The process of collecting and reviewing showcases is now much easier. The OGD Office encourages at every opportunity (e.g. events, Twitter, LinkedIn) to upload showcases. Another way to collect reuse cases is the example of the open data portal of the city of Bern: they have formulated potential ideas and questions for the reuse of their open data and added links to corresponding datasets, see: https://www.bern.ch/open-government-data-ogd/ideen-fuer-dienstleistungen.
Another way is to bring together students and data publishers. An example is that of the Bern University of
of Applied Sciences: https://www.digitale-nachhaltigkeit.unibe.ch/studium/open_data_veranstaltung/fruehjahrssemester_2023/index_ger.html. It encourages the collaboration between public bodies and students. They are looking for data coaches every year.

""The impact of open data on the perception of transparency does not seem to be significant. Our findings show that open data does not increase the transparency of public administrations, which is understood as a continuous process that goes beyond simple data provision. This perception is certainly motivated by the fact that the random release of datasets does not always make them useful or valuable for users (Susha et al., Citation2015). In this sense, it appears crucial to note that open data, if it is to serve the purpose of greater administrative transparency, should be developed in a way that guarantees possible reuse by and empowerment of citizens.""

Clerks then created the desired data manually, made it available to the architects via FTP and then triggered an invoice. This involved all accounting processes. OGD eliminated all administrative processes and customers had their data available immediately and at any time. And another example: Data on Road noise emissions for construction clients. Since the beginning of 2023 a new emission calculation model ""sonROAD18"" became state of the art in Zurich. As of this date, road noise calculations may only be performed using the new model. Since July 2022, the Noise Abatement Department has made the relevant data about emissions of the road noise pollution register according to sonROAD18 freely available to the acoustics offices and other interested parties in a specially prepared form and together with other basic data for noise calculations. Also here, the relevant Open Data was included in the relevant process from the beginning, leading to very efficient and effective processes.
- Government organizations are motivated to publish data on the data portal because they can use the tool that the OGD Portal from Basel-City uses to create simple dashboards and analytics. Here is an example of the Covid dashboard and the traffic accident dashboard. https://data.bs.ch/pages/verkehrsunfall_dashboard_basel/ 
https://data.bs.ch/pages/covid-19-dashboard/ They have received feedback that this saves them a lot of time and effort. 
- Regional OGD portals support their offices in transforming the structured information into machine-readable datasets, describing them with metadata and using them to produce information for the general public. Building your application directly on open data is more efficient. For example as visualization: https://www.zh.ch/de/sicherheit-justiz/sicher-unterwegs/verkehrsunfallstatistiken.html 
- For example drinking water quality canton zurich - Here, the cantonal laboratory and the municipalities themselves measure. Both now flow into two OGD datasets (one classic from the laboratory, one that is continuously filled in collaboratively by the municipalities) and these two datasets flow into an overview of drinking water quality.

- Because the role of data is becoming increasingly important for the city, open and transparent communication about the collection and use of this data is significant: The city of Zurich for example is testing in a pilot trial how it can make the collection of data in public spaces more visible. In concrete terms, this is being done by clearly labelling sensors with pictograms. In addition, the latest available data of the respective sensors will be prepared on the website of the city of Zurich and made accessible on site via QR code. For this purpose, only data from already existing sensors is used, which is open and freely accessible as ""open data"": https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/prd/de/index/stadtentwicklung/smart-city/transparenz.html - part of this sensor data is offered as visualisation, for example: https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/prd/de/index/stadtentwicklung/smart-city/transparenz/luft/stampfenbachstrasse.html   
- Climate and energy-relevant information for all Swiss residential buildings can now be seen on the federal government's geoportal.

- in Switzerland the process of publishing OGD, that is a ""relationship"" between state and private actors, is considered to be part of the public law.

Version 2.0.0 has recently been approved by eCH. The definition area is https://dcat-ap.ch/. There you will find both versions of the DCAT-AP CH. The portal is mainly based on the DCAT-AP conformance, but also on the version 1 of the DCAT-AP CH, as it contains some Swiss fields used by the community. The decision to create a version 2 of DCAT-AP CH and to keep a national application profile was a difficult one. We decided to keep it because there are particularities in the use of the standard, there are properties such as distribution coverage that the Swiss community relies on and that can't be found in DCAT-AP. The vocabulary also needs Swiss adaptations. Licences are used in a different way than in DCAT-AP. We felt that it would better support the Swiss community if Switzerland maintained its own profile and explained how classes and properties are adapted to the Swiss context. While version 1 of DCAT-AP CH was not DCAT-AP compatible with version 2.0.1 of DCAT-AP. DCAT-AP CH V2 is now compatible with DCAT-AP.;;;;;5

For justification:
* Please list the most common causes and select 'see answer box'.";see answer box;As we are a CKAN portal, the main reason for the lack of DCAT-AP compliance is that as a portal we can't pass through complex data catalogue structures coming from data publishers, even if they are DCAT-AP compliant. We map RDF to postgres on import and postgres to RDF on export. In the process, we lose classes and properties that we don't use on opendata.swiss. What we are trying to do in terms of DCAT-AP compliance is to make our export DCAT-AP compliant as well as making sure that our import is DCAT-AP compliant. But there is still something that gets lost in this internal mapping. A recent example that illustrates this is the categories. We map EU categories, but the portal has Swiss categories implemented. So we might get EU categories from a datapublisher, but because of the mapping to postgres, we would map those categories to Swiss categories and on export to EU categories. His original EU categories will be lost.;;;;;15
