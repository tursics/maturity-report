OpenCity portal combines smart solutions to increase the transparency and openness of cities, municipalities and counties in Croatia.

Any local unit that has clearly opened the information to its citizens can report their solution and find a place on the openCity portal. To illustrate the power of graphically presented information, basic budget visualizations were developed for all cities and municipalities.

Among the participants, those local units that took a step further, joined the project and raised the bar of transparency were especially highlighted:

Accountability 
A recent application of the Association of Croatian Counties (regional level, includes 20 counties) called Open Budget enables visualisation of budget spending at regional level, using relevant criteria (sector, type, etc.). It ensures that budget data are available in unified manner, open format and visualised per different criteria. The application uses open data on spending at the county level, allowing for comparison, analysis and ensuring transparency and accountability:

The project has drawn attention of local governments so the Association of Cities and Association of Municipalities who are planning to incentivise their members to create similar applications, and allow extraction of open budget and financial data.

In 2018, the Republic of Croatia adopted the Open Data Policy, a document whose purpose is to build and develop a stimulating environment for the creation of new social value by opening the public sector data. The fundamental goals of the policy are: maximum openness of public data in accordance with the highest standards, use of open data to create new social value, achieving a level of knowledge and awareness of the meaning and value of open data and the possibilities for their reuse, support for all open data providers and providing opportunities for capacity building in management and use and better connection of public bodies at the local and regional level, with an emphasis on the opening of regional and city portals of open data. A new open data policy is currently being prepared. Through Open data policy, we also tackle some strategic considerations about open data. 
The Croatian Parliament had adopted the Digital Croatia Strategy for the period  until 2032 (NN 002/2023).  The importance of open data is highlighted in the Strategy.";;This answer is similar to Q1.
