Transposition of the Open Directive is still in progress: https://www.regjeringen.no/no/sub/eos-notatbasen/notatene/2018/juni/endring-viderebruksdirektivet/id2604081/

The Government has trough ""Data as a resource"" (https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/meld.-st.-22-20202021/id2841118/?ch=2) set the following principles for its data policy:
1. Data must be as open as possible and as closed as necessary.
2. Data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR).
3. Data must be shared and used in ways that create value for the private sector, the public sector and society.
4. Data must be shared and used in ways that respect fundamental rights and freedoms and preserve Norwegian social values.

The Norwegian government has established a public committee to assess the appropriate implementation of the directive (https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/kdd/org/styrer-rad-og-utvalg/viderebruksutvalget/id2926740/). The committee's proposed regulation of the reuse of data will be based on the Public Access to Information Act with regulations and EU Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and reuse of information from the public sector. The above-mentioned directive is a minimum directive, and therefore the committee is asked to consider whether Norway should go beyond the thematic categories that follow from the directive when it comes to datasets of high value, and also include other datasets than those covered by the EU's implementing act on datasets of high value.";The answer option 'Other' should be selected by countries that do not have a specific open data policy in place but have a national policy (on data, digitalisation, artificial intelligence, eGovernment or similar) that explicitly includes open data in its text and scope.;;;;30

Digital agenda for Norway
Establishes information as a key resource in the public sector. Emphasis on once-only and holistic information management.
Establishes three main reasons why access to open public data is important for society:
1. Streamlining and innovation
2. Business development
3. An open and democratic society

In addition, cross-sectoral instruments have been established to promote access to and re-use of public data:
- Dataportal (data.norge.no)
- Dataset distribution service
- Guidelines for re-use of public data
- Guidance for making open data available
- Development of a Norwegian license for public data
The strategy also identifies important sectors with open data that are socio-economically important

National strategy on access to and sharing of research data
The strategy is part of the follow-up to Meld. St. 27 (2015–2016), Digital agenda for Norway.
The strategy deals with increased accessibility to and reuse of publicly funded research data. It describes the state of affairs on which the policy is based and the current situation at the research institutions. Three basic principles relating to the accessibility and sharing of research data are set out:
1. Research data must be as open as possible, as closed as necessary
2. Research data should be managed and curated to take full advantage of their potential

• Investigate a legal obligation to publish open data (ongoing)
• Develop a strategy for artificial intelligence (completed)
• Develop a method for measuring the effects of data sharing (completed for open data from the public sector used in the private sector)

Digtial Agenda specifies that it will continue with and build upon existing tools for open data and that sectoral strategies be prepared in the culture, education, transport, mapping and Government spending sectors. Open data strategies have been made for five of these sectors and can be found here.

Sharing of industrial data (Expert group) 
Sharing of industrial data recommends a sharper distinction between static data (datasets) and dynamic data (data streams). This is because dynamic data is more often operational than datasets, and for dynamic data there will be greater expectations of what obligations the provider of the data service has. The expert group does not explicitly differentiate between open and closed data, but instead looks closer at different usage rights (licensing) for data.";Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time). ;;;;15

The Framework for Information Management specifies that each organisation should create and maintain a data inventory https://www.digdir.no/informasjonsforvaltning/rammeverk-informasjonsforvaltning/2118. Some examples of organisations with very good inventories are The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration, The company register, Stavanger Municipality, The tax Authorities.

The national guidance for information management https://data.norge.no/guide/veileder-orden-i-eget-hus/ states:
""Den enkelte virksomhet skal ha oversikt over hvilke data den håndterer, hva dataene betyr, hva de brukes til, hvilke prosesser de inngår i, og hvem som kan bruke dem (informasjonsforvaltning).""

Unofficial translation is as follows 
""Each organisation must have an overview over which data they manage, what the data means, what it is being used for, which processes they are involved in, and who can use them"".

The digitalisation circular  https://www.regjeringen.no/id2952701/
obliges all state enterprises to register the national data catalogue. Unofficial translation: ""The company must register data sets in the Common Data Catalog (data.norge.no).

;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;525
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

For justification:
* If yes, please specify what kind of data proves this impact and provide the URLs to this data.";yes;"Norway does not have a general report on the effects of open data on governmental challenges. Use of data and analyzes of effects are largely linked to use cases, and essentially the data used is a mixture of open data and data with restrictions. A recent report (2022) concludes that measuring effects and gains from a single data set, especially into services, is difficult and that there are few feasible methods.

We have several reports relating to the effect of various use cases. For the example used in the answer, the White Paper on Readily Available and Accessible (Open) Marine Geospatial Information can be referred to. 

In 2020, an assessment was made of the societal benefit of BarentsWatch. In the report presented, it is concluded that they fulfill an important societal need. Furthermore, the report points out that measuring the usefulness of information sharing is demanding as it is not the information itself, but the use of it that possibly creates value for society. Of benefit to society, the following are highlighted:
• Cost savings in the public sector
• Increased profit for business
• Reduced environmental costs
• Reduced accident costs
• Reduced crime (increased safety)
• Increased trust

Within different sectors there are several different reports and analyses. Examples:
• Faster response time with geographical analysis (planning of ambulance services): https://geodata.no/bransjer/raskere-responstid-med-geografisk-analyse
• The value of free map and property data: https://www.regjeringen.no/globalassets/upload/kmd/plan/verdien-av-gratis-kart-og-eiendomsdata.pdf

""The national statistics bank is used for various purposes. One example is The Technical Calculation Committee for Income Settlements.""The Technical Calculation Committee for Income Settlements uses statistical data in several ways in its work:

Analysis of Economic Trends: They use statistical data to analyze economic trends, including inflation, wage development, employment, and other economic indicators. This provides them with a picture of the current economic situation.

Reference Data: Statistical data serve as reference data to compare current income levels and working conditions with previous years. This helps them assess changes over time.

Modeling and Forecasts: They can use statistical models to create forecasts for future economic conditions, including wage growth, price inflation, and other economic variables. This is important for planning income settlements.

Insight into Sectors: Statistical data provide insight into various sectors of the economy, such as industry, services, the public sector, etc. This allows them to assess how changes in income settlements will affect different parts of the economy.

Comparisons with Other Countries: They can also compare Norwegian data with statistics from other countries to assess how competitive wage and working conditions are compared to international standards.

The Norwegian Public Roads Administration collects a lot of data about road, environment, weather and so on. This data is used extensively when planning traffic, environmental and fiscal policy or measures. Most of the data is open. https://data.norge.no/organizations/971032081

Language use is increasingly dependent upon a wide range of digital applications, and (lack of) access to such applications will essentially govern the possibilities linguistic minorities have to use their languages. Dictionary resources are freely abailable for others to use, not only in open interfaces (https://sanit.oahpa.no/, etc.) but also the content.

Some municipalities use air quality data to implement restrictions on driving and wood-burning: https://www.bergen.kommune.no/hvaskjer/tema/luftkvalitet/strakstiltak/hvilke-regler-gjelder-ved-datokjoring

In some municipalities, air quality data is utilized to assess the level of air pollution, particularly in terms of particulate matter (PM) and pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). When air quality deteriorates to a certain extent, these municipalities may implement restrictions on activities that contribute to air pollution, such as:

Driving Restrictions: They may impose temporary driving restrictions, particularly on vehicles with high emissions or during periods of high pollution, like smog or haze events. This can include measures like alternating license plate numbers allowed on the road on specific days.

Wood-Burning Bans: During periods of poor air quality or high pollution, some municipalities may ban or restrict the use of wood-burning stoves or fireplaces to reduce the emission of particulate matter and other pollutants from burning wood.

These measures aim to improve air quality and protect public health by reducing exposure to harmful pollutants. The specific restrictions and their enforcement can vary from one municipality to another, depending on local air quality conditions and regulations.";;;Could you elaborate on the impact created by these open data reuse cases?;;15
