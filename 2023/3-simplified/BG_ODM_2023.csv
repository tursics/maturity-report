In Bulgaria, there is an interest in the open data policy at the national level and to examine the level of re-use. Program ""Research, Innovation and Digitization for Intelligent Transformation"" (PNIIDIT) meets the strategic needs and priorities of Bulgaria for accelerated economic development through investments in the development of scientific research, scientific infrastructure, innovation and smart industry and the rapid entry of digital technologies into the economy and society. The program will support the unfolding of the potential of the data, which will lead to including supporting the introduction of the assessment methodology in the field of open data. Under PNIIDIT, a network of 12 European digital and information hubs will be built by applying the so-called synergistic European approach. Hubs are a key component of the innovation ecosystem and infrastructure by region, as their activity is directly aimed at helping SMEs and supporting the digital and innovation capacity of enterprises in key areas such as high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, cyber security and others.
The program will also support the digital transformation of the public sector and the deployment of the potential of data in strategic economic areas and spheres of public interest. Data spaces as part of the European data strategy are one of the tools for creating a single data market in the EU and hence in Bulgaria, in which data from different sectors - public institutions, private entities and citizens are used under the same, equal conditions and thereby promoting the development of innovation, growth and competitiveness.

On the recommendation of the EC, Bulgaria raised the level of ambition for the share of energy from renewable sources in the gross final energy consumption from 25% to 27.09%, thereby betting on achieving the calculated goal, according to Annex II to Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 In support of this goal, Bulgaria will build additional capacities with an emphasis on wind and solar energy. Also, if necessary to achieve the set goals after 2025, it is possible to hold tenders for additional capacities for energy from renewable sources, tailored to market conditions. Biomass use is projected to increase in all sectors: electricity, heat and cooling, and transport. The anticipated changes in the transport sector will have a significant impact on the development of energy from renewable sources, as well as on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. More specifically, Bulgaria will promote the introduction and use of electric and hybrid vehicles in public and private transport, envisaging the creation of low-emission zones in major cities. These measures, among others, will contribute to a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in Bulgaria.

Climate action means social justice. A key message of our leadership is that social justice and social well-being are intricately linked to the environment and climate. After all, it is the more financially vulnerable part of the middle class that always suffers more from the climate crisis than those who have a secure web of privilege and a sufficient financial buffer to absorb the brunt of this crisis. . These are the small farmers who are losing their livelihoods because of the drought, the elderly population who have to endure increasingly hot summers, the middle class people who live in the suburbs and commute to work constantly stuck in traffic, or who live along highways and industrial areas and constantly inhale harmful Preface Preface - 7 gases, or workers in automobile factories whose jobs are at risk because company management ignores the winds of change and clings too long to outdated technologies, missing out on too many business opportunities. Whether it is decentralized energy supply, sustainable transport or a just coal transition, where ex-coal workers are given sustainable 'green' jobs and thus secure a stable income for their families, ambitious climate policies help the people who would otherwise be hit hardest by the impacts of a rapidly changing climate. These policies give them security and prospects. By meeting the challenges of the current climate reality head-on, ""green"" policies put our lives and the lives of our children on a firmer footing.

54;yes;"Many people cannot immediately switch to alternative sources, especially in large cities.
The use of renewable sources, together with the rational use of energy, is an important driving force of sustainable development and at the same time ensures the achievement of the goals of security of energy supply and reduces dependence on sudden changes in oil prices, contributes to the reduction of trade imbalances and stimulates the creation to new jobs.
Bulgaria has actively joined international efforts to prevent climate change by adopting the agreed goals of the European Union and the large-scale package of measures in the field of energy.
Renewable energy sources and energy efficiency http://www.repowermap.org/?ln=bg
Bulgaria's renewable energy generation capacity increased by almost 15% last year to 5,205 megawatts (MW) from 4,532 megawatts in 2021, and by 27% over ten years (compared to 4,095 megawatts in 2013), they said. them. data from the annual report of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

There is evidence that the release of open data has led to an increase in the efficiency of some public bodies. For example, since the launch of the Agency for Sustainable Energy's portal, open data on different energy sources can be queried via APIs, rather than running custom queries and Excel exports for individual queries. Information seekers can now be directed to their open data API. Previously, it took a long time to respond to queries and the data was not up to date after the query was executed. A new reference was being prepared for the next applicant. Data is now dynamic and the burden on internal resources to manage data requests has been reduced.

On the side. This is also a response to the need to speed up the digitization processes of the public sector and build a favorable digital environment to guarantee quality and secure exchange of information between the different spheres of life and strengthen the effects of their interaction. This affects the level of adoption of new technologies.

The open data impact of the program is to expand the volume and improve the quality of open and spatial data in machine-readable format for reuse by business, the scientific community and citizens to create innovative services and products and add value to the economy and society . Also, the impact is expressed in building new models of interaction and data sharing between citizens, businesses and administration in a digital environment, as well as development of existing such relevant solutions and last but not least in promoting the conduct of marco-economic and micro-economic studies for the assessment of the impact of open data.";;please clarify the use and impact created by open data in these examples.;;20

https://bgfundforwomen.org/bg/2022/05/04/mypath-project-2022/
The Bulgarian Fund for Women is part of the essential part of the development of the MyPath project under the European Union program in the field of education, youth and sports ""Erasmus+"", in partnership with three other organizations, in Austria, Germany and Portugal. The project ""MyPath: Career planning - participation of medium and/or higher skilled migrant women and women from ethnic minorities in the labor market"" includes companies and organizations from the non-governmental sector working in the field of retraining and combating unemployment, coaching and mentoring, as well as specialization in the organization of professional training and preparation.
The loss and weakening of work-related skills is a common barrier for migrant women, but also for women from ethnic minorities, who can often be overqualified for their jobs. Moreover, the emphasis on migrant women in the low-skilled sectors of the labor market and on the so-called 'male' sectors of the skilled labor market further obscures the presence of skilled migrant women in the labor market. As a result, skilled migrant and ethnic minority women across the EU continue to face challenges within and outside their communities that have a detrimental effect on their equal participation in society. Discrimination and social exclusion reduce their ability to seek their rights and place them in an extremely vulnerable situation where poverty and violence can mix in a closed circle. Barriers to employment are often lack of childcare opportunities, lower levels of working language proficiency, insufficient self-esteem and external support, and fixed cultural role models. To be successful in professional development planning, initial support such as empowerment and capacity building, as well as motivation building, is paramount.
The Bulgarian Fund for Women is an entity that influences equality policies and develops projects and initiatives to increase the participation of women in social life and the digital environment and data science with a gender perspective. It seeks to harness the potential of specific groups of people and promotes women's upskilling and data-based decision-making in its work.";;please clarify the use and impact created by open data in these examples.;;0
