* If ‘other’, please provide (1) a brief explanation to support your answer choice and (2) provide the URL and indicate the policy section which explicitly references open data.";yes;"Yes, there is a data strategy in Sweden since October 2021, and in chapter 4 about ""Styrning, reglering och uppföljning"" (in eng. governance, regulations, and follow-ups) the transposition of the open data directive into national law is specifically outlined as a strategically important area. 
LINK: https://www.regeringen.se/informationsmaterial/2021/10/data--en-underutnyttjad-resurs-for-sverige/

However, the actual investigation preseeding the national law was handled as a separate process, so the data strategy could be said to point to that work in a supportive manner, rather than investigation being a part of the data strategy.

2022 (vi kan ta bort detta tycker jag):
Since 1th of August 2022, there is a new law in Sweden that fullfills the requirements layed out in the open data directive.
The government is proposing a new law on making data from the the public sector available. The amendments to the law are proposed to enter into force on 1 August 2022  (https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/proposition/2022/04/prop.-202122225/)  The Swedish Government outlined  a broader national digitalisation strategy already 2017 (https://www.regeringen.se/regeringens-politik/digitaliseringsstrategin/) how the digitization policy should contribute to competitiveness, full employment and economic, social and environmentally sustainable development. The strategy outlines the importance of public sector information and open data as a fuel for digital innovation and new services, improved efficiencies and for our democratic and transparent society in Sweden. The information produced or collected in the public sector is an asset that is common to state and municipal authorities and society in general. By refining, compiling and using information in other ways, different actors can create new commercial and non-profit services and thereby provide the conditions for society to take advantage of the value that the information can have when used for purposes other than the authorities' own activities. Operators who want to re-use public information should, as far as possible, access data. The Government believes that it should be as simple as possible for as many people as possible to assimilate the value of this information collection. Authorities should actively strive to enable efficient re-use of public information to facilitate the emergence of an information market.

To implement the  this strategy the Agency for Digital Government (DIGG) was established in September 2018 with the purpose to support digitalisation in public administration with infrastructure and shared digital services. DIGG are mandated to promote open and datadriven innovation, the re-use of public information. 

Efforts supporting the strategy
- DIGG is responsible for the national framework of Europeean Interoperability Framework (EIF) where ""open by default"" is one pillar, see q1. https://www.digg.se/utveckling-av-digital-forvaltning/svenskt-ramverk-for-digital-samverkan.

The strategy contains goals with timelines as: 1) All state administrative authorities that can streamline operations and simplify for companies and citizens with the help of shared data, AI and data-driven analysis must have started this work by 2025 at the latest. 2) Publicly funded research data must, where appropriate, be open and accessible by 2026 and 3)  Swedish companies should be leading players in the internal market for data in 2030.

For justification:
If yes, please briefly describe the main measures described by the action plan.";yes;"Yes, the national datastrategy outlines six strategic areas, and in each strategic area there are a number of strategic efforts/action plan described. The national datastrategy has goals including the open data field for 2023-2025. These can be for example specific goverment assignments or other types of actions and described goals. In particular the following strategic sections are related to open data: ""Insatsområde 1: Ökad tillgång till data"" (in eng.

6a;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to real-time or dynamic data?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";No;UPDATED ANSWER:The values of dynamic data  and real time data are described in the datastrategy and the strategy outlines that the Agency for digital government shall outline measures. But the Agency of digital government has not received a governmental mission to actually follow up on the strategy or to outline measures based on the strategy. ;Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time). ;;"By dynamic data, we mean data that changes over time (see ""Guide to Answering"").

For justification:
*  Could you briefly describe why this model was chosen/works best for your country?";hybrid;"The Swedish model is decentralised with government agencies, regional authorities and local municipalites. The federal government cannot give special assignments to municipalites so the model has taken into account for this, to rather use external government funding and incentives for the local/regional level.

#The ministry assigns centrally funded projects and initiatives to speed up progress in selected areas/domains/sectors. 
#Innovation agency funds and incentivives local and regional, and domain specific labs through government funding. 
#However, since our open by default policy and there are many initiatives that are developed and pursued at local level with no central guidance, or as a part of business development. 

We encourage local and sector-specific projects, however it is a challenge to coordinate all and drive them to publish the data so that it is visible through the national open data portal. To further incentivavives open data and data for innovation and AI development, Innovation agency Vinnova funds projects. Vinnova, The National Innovation Agency are financing and incentivising initiatives for open and datadriven innvotion incl establishment of open data labs, cubs and factories in each sector.

For justification:
* If yes, please provide the URL and briefly highlight the key aspects covered. ";yes;"Yes, but depending on the open data maturity of the organisation, these publication plans can differ in extent and level of detail. Our assessment is that the municipalities (290 in Sweden), since many of them are rather small and lack resources, are those with the biggest challenges to come up with a data publication plan. We know that many organisation do have some sort of plan, however, not available online. 

The project ""Nationell dataverkstad"" (in eng. National data workshop) helps Regions and municipalities with the on-boarding process, which includes coming up with a plan for publishing data as open data. At the moment, 10 regions (including many of their municipalities) have joined the project. In Sweden we have 21 regions, so the aim of the project is to get the 11 other regions to joins during 2023.

# Digg has a package of principles and recommendations related to open data sharing. See https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer. This support package was extended in Nov 2022 with new guidelines related to the procurement of data in order to improve the long-term possibilities for data to e.g. be relased as open data and in machine readible formats. See https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer/rekommendationer-for-upphandling-av-data. In april 2023 additional support to these guidelines in the form of text examples of requirements to use in the procurement process was released.

# Digg funds the regional project Nationell Dataverkstad (described in Q 24b) and has personel working in the project. 

# During 2022, Digg has been engaged in a lot of activities related to the National data strategy and a government assignment related to open data sharing. https://www.regeringen.se/regeringsuppdrag/2021/06/uppdrag-att-framja-delning-och-nyttiggorande-av-data/ .

;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;505
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

These actor search for general information about re-use. Among more mature organisations, the interest for the level of re-use is more focused on the kind of re-use and effects of data in various application areas, such as AI and sustainable development. 
Here are some observations: 
-	In most open seminars related open data it is common to get questions related to understanding the nature and levels of re-use of data. Particularity for data providers, the issue of ""what´s in it for us?"" is still very common.
-	Last years government assignment to DIGG was partly focused on supporting the understanding and ability among public actors to create results and benefits by using open data. This was based on identified needs related to re-use.
-	The Agency for digital government has started to explore possible solutions to measure the levels of re-use of data at various public organisations.

Moreover, as assigned with responsibility to foster the open data movement in Sweden, in 2020 the Agency for digital government (DIGG) described open data impacts as the following areas:
1) overall economic benefits (e.g. referring to the HVD-analys from 2020)
2) new innovative services and products
3) a data driven knowledge society
4) A more efficient and innovative public administration
5) the growth of data journalism
6) research with new possibilities
7) a resource for AI. 

See information about DIGGs description on impacts in Swedish: https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data 

In addition to the highlighted areas of impact, potential data users were also categorized based on identified need of data and general characteristics: 1) information driven users, 2) development driven users, 3) organisation improvement driven users, and 4) analysis driven users.

# DIGG is also hosting a project about basic data, which focuses on both data that can be fully open and data that can be shared only within public sector, which gives additional insights into these re-use impacts. 

# At local level, the processes for estimating the impact of re-use are set up by public bodies at their developer portals, open registries/databases etc. Most public bodies that have an API strategy measures the re-use as well as have web analytics on their websites.";With methodology we refer to practices, frameworks, methods developed/employed, regardless of their maturity level.;;;;30

These public bodies are using the data to: 
1) increase the efficiency in decisions regarding a clear-cut notification referred to them by the SFA. If there is a nature reserve or sensitive area adjacent to the clear-cut notification, then the CB will write informing the SFA which will inform the forest owner not to encroach on this in any way.
2) efficient processes in making decisions regarding new nature reserves. For example, if there is an adjacent area which has been cleared, then much of the biodiversity value will have been lost and they will not waste time evaluating the new notification.
-inform the SEPA which will ask the CB for an annual update on the sensitive areas. Whilst SEPA will already know the nature reserves and the areas under surveillance, only the county knows if there are further areas which maybe under consideration. Hence the CB provides an updated map to SEPA showing any new such areas.

For justification:
* If yes, please (1) specify what kind of data proves this impact and (2) provide the URLs to this data. ";yes;"UPDATED ANSWER:
Yes, in preparation for negotiations on the list with valuable datasets listed in the open data and psi directive the Swedish National geological survey agency calculated the value of certain datasets. Environmental data was part of two that were calculated. Geological data was valued at 800 million SEK/year and i almost entirely environmental data. Geospatial data was valued at 5 400 milion SEK/year and is in large part environmental data.  Part of this is already released as open data and some was estimates in impact on releasing this as open data, see attached word doc for detailed status on availability/openness of the data. 

The analysis showed, of the proposed data sets, property data, geodetic data, soil type data, species observations, red-listed animals and plants, satellite images as well as image and altitude data can contribute especially to the work with the UN's environmental and climate goals in Agenda 2030 with the 17 sustainability goals. Making the proposed amounts of data available contributes to both the national and the international work towards these goals. Nationally, the effects are seen, among other things, in the form of the promotion of biodiversity, environmental protection, streamlined work in forests and land and increased opportunities for individuals to use nature and its resources. Internationally, the effects are seen in the form of simplified collaborations and increased access to information when data from different countries can be combined to solve global challenges regarding environmental and climate impact. Thus, they constitute the proposed data sets an important piece of the puzzle in solving global climate and environmental problems

For justification:
*Please describe what is the agreed approach.
* If less than the majority of data providers, please briefly explain why (e.g. technical incompatibilities, governance aspects, low awareness etc.).";Few public sector data providers;"In Sweden, a number of different aspects contribute to the relatively low degree of public sector data providers.

# Municipalites and county regions in particular are governed with a very high degree of self-governance, that is, the decentralized government structure makes is difficult (if not impossible) to strongly incentivise these actors to share data they do not have to release. The implementation of high-value datasets in the new data law makes it easier for us (at Digg, the Authority for digital government) to work towards increased data sharing.

# Many public actors report technical challenges related to their metadata catalogue, and therefore we will launch a service for a shared metadata catalogue at dataportal.se during 2023.  The analysis covering this challenge can be found here: https://www.digg.se/analys-och-uppfoljning/publikationer/publikationer/2022-03-09-tekniska-forutsattningar-for-oppna-data

# A generally low awareness among public actors about open data, and in particular on the benefits of open data and how they get started. To adress this we launced an basic education programme called ""Data ambassador"" in Feb 2023 which gives the basics in open data including the general benefits. We now have more than 100 registrered participants. During 2023, we are also developing a learning initiative (education like) specifically for leaders and managers in public organisations.

For justification:
* If yes, could you provide some examples of the actions taken in this regard.";yes, or all public sector data providers already publish data;"During 2022 we performed several actions to assist data providers:

# We launced a recommended REST API-profile for public actors (and others). See https://www.dataportal.se/sv/nyheter/18/rest-api-profil-okar-kvaliteten-pa-api-er

# Together with the Swedish public employment service (a public agency) we developed a tool called the ""DCAT-AP-processorn"" which enables data providers to automatically create metadata from an existing API. See https://www.dataportal.se/sv/nyheter/17/nytt-verktyg-for-att-automatiskt-skapa-metadata  

# We started to develop the dataportal into more of a digital arena for knowledge sharing and dialogue with more important support (e.g. an additional focus on open source and public AI). The updated dataportal will also have increased support for co-created content (e.g. re-use examples), that is, more actors can be given publication access e.g. other public actors, projects that work with data sharing or for example Smart cities or IoT. We are not there yet, but we are working on it, see https://beta.dataportal.se/ 

# We developed new recommendations for the procurement of data so that when data is aquired it will be easier to open up. See https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer/rekommendationer-for-upphandling-av-data 

# We started developing a shared metadata catalogue to make it easier for public actors to get starting in their sharing of data. 

# We developed the education ""Data ambassadors"" (recorded a lot of videos, developed quiz's and other educational material such as a set of Power Point files for there usage). This was launched in Feb 2023, see link in Q 91.

# We have conducted a number of information seminars about the new data law (based on the Open data directive), see https://www.dataportal.se/sv/nyheter/15/digg-bjuder-in-till-informationstraffar-om-den-foreslagna-datalagen. In addition to seminars, we have also developed a support page about the data law with a stronger legal perspective, see https://www.digg.se/kunskap-och-stod/oppna-och-delade-data/offentliga-aktorer/information-om-oppna-datalagen";;;;;10

# The national geodata portal is managed by the national mapping agency (see https://www.lantmateriet.se/) and hosts data from municipalities, county regions and public agencies. Link: https://www.lantmateriet.se/sv/geodata/Geodataportalen/

# The national statistics database is held by the agency Statics Sweden (see https://www.scb.se/en/) and contains statistics from a variety of public actors. Link: https://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/sv/ssd/ 

# The national research data portal is hosted by Gothenburg university but is owned by a konsortium of 40 academic institutions (such as universities) and contains shared research data. Link: https://snd.gu.se/en 

# A regional dataportal that contains data from both the county region ""Region Västra Götaland"" and some of its municipalities in the region is Dataportal Väst. Link: https://www.vgregion.se/ov/dataportal-vast/datakatalog 

In addition to dataportals that contains data from several actors, there are also several ""dataportals"" that only consists of data from one actor, resembling more these actors own web for their open data.

* If applicable, please provide the URL to the documentation of the national DCAT-AP extension.";yes;"UPDATED ANSWER:
Yes there is. Documentation for the Swedish DCAT-AP standard (DCAT-AP-SE) is available in the technical documentation for the national dataportal: https://docs.dataportal.se/dcat/ Here you can find the standard in both Swedish and in English.
DCAT-AP-SE contains clarifications, translations and explanations of DCAT-AP for Sweden. DCAT-AP-SE is a national adaption of DCAT-AP, which could be compared with DCAT-AP as a European adaption of DCAT (W3C). The reason to have a national adaption is to make it easier for Swedish data producers to use DCAT-AP-SE and to make a uniform description of data sets. The data producers are required to use DCAT-AP-SE to make metadata about their data available at the Swedish data portal. DCAT-AP-SE is developed in collaboration to suit the Swedish context of organisations and data domains and to simplify the collection, search and presentation of data at the Swedish data portal. The main differences from the standard EU version is a translation to Swedish, more detailed explanations and suggestions of how to use recommended and optional fields in the Swedish context.

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe.";yes;"Yes, we use the 5-star open data model as a reference and example for having various dialogues on data quality, and how data producers can increase the data quality over time. Also, we use this model in our education ""Data ambassadors"" as a pedagic example on how they can start on a rather low level and then increase the the data quality and means for access to data (via e.g. an API). Some public actors get stressed over linked data, and then we can also use the 5-star open data model to show that linked data can be seen as a goal rather than as the starting point.
