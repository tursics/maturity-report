3;yes;The new Law was approved in June 2022 and has additional provisions on national level high value domains and datasets, on administrative measures for non-compliant PSB, licencing and public participation on establishing future HVDs.;;;;10
4;Yes;(Review 1: Answer revised to yes) Timisoara OGP Local Action Plan includes a commitment on open data: https://www.opengovpartnership.org/members/timisoara-romania/commitments/ROTMR0003/.  The commitment is aimed at increasing the quality and quantity of available open data. Proposed actions include peer exchanges, census of public data held by public institutions and other relevant stakeholders, publication of 10 high value open data sets and standardization of their structure, guidelines for periodic identification of high value data, publication and maintenance of the published data, engage re-users etc.;In the previous year, Timisoara municipality had a local policy in place (https://www.opengovpartnership.org/members/timisoara-romania/commitments/ROTMR0003/).

6d;yes;The law states that the data should be available / discoverable on the national open data portal, hence on data.europa.eu as well.;;;;10
7;Yes;(Review 1: Answer revised to yes) The law includes measures to ensure data requests are processed correctly (including sanctions on non abiding institutions), data is published in open formats with metadata and using open standards, it also recommends the CC licences for published data. In addition, the aplication norms, now under development, focus on the importance of maintaining a permanent dialogue with re-users, especially in prioritising data sets for publication, to align to their needs in terms of frequency, format, availability etc.;"In the previous ODM, you indicated “yes”. Is the previous year’s answer still relevant? ""The law includes measures to ensure data requests are processed correctly (including sanctions on non-abiding institutions), data is published in open formats with metadata and using open standards, it also recommends the CC licences for published data.""";;;15

9b;yes;the implementing act (under public consultation - https://data.gov.ro/blog/intalnire-de-lucru-elaborare-norme-de-aplicare-legea-nr-179-2022) reiterates the importance that these inventories should include all data held by the public entity.;;;;10

10b;yes, other measures;At this moment, stakeholders have been informed on the timeline and provisions for the implementation of the Regulation, through various working groups or webinars, especially in the wider context of the European data legislative framework (DGA, DA etc). Following meetings with all the public entities that hold HVDs, the discussions will include other stakeholders, too.;;;;5
10c;yes;"The main challenges identified so far include: in terms of mind-sets, there is reluctance to open all datasets; lack of understanding of the wider benefits of opening the data (economic, social etc).
In terms of financial losses: part of the data in the Regulation is currently sold, alternative funding sources must be identifies; In terms of the need for further investments in human resources and infrastructure to comply mainly with the frequency of collection and updates for dynamic data; Some legislative problems, as current legislation allows for exclusive contracts etc.; Taxonomy / vocabulary issues are likely to be encountered due to lack of standardisation at national level.

12;yes; The governance structure is composed of the team within the Secretariat-General of the Government (that holds most attributions in the coordination of the open data inititative) and the Authority for the Digitalization of Romania (transposition mainly attributions).  The SGG activities are conducted with the participation /inclusion of stakeholders (data stewards from the central/local administration, re-users, academia, civil society), as reflected in the implementation of the open data commitments in the OGP National Action Plans developed, implemented and monitored in collaboration with civil society) or the active participation of stakeholders in open data meetings and debates on various issues (https://data.gov.ro/blog).;;;;30
13;hybrid;The approach is mainly top-down in terms of legislative framework, dissemination of knowledge and good practices, coordination etc. However, as there are starting to be local open data initiatives, we are now supporting them from the central level, and they are also working together to promote their good practices to peers from other municipalities.;;;;N/A
14;yes, all initiatives;All open data initiatives are supported by the national open data team through one-to-one assistance, webinars, facillitation of collaboration with reusers, provision of available resources and standards. This is more so since the national portal should be the main point of access, as included in the law. As regards to the local initiatives, there are two approaches: some chose to upload directly on the national portal and some cities prefer to develop their own portals. This second approach usually is more cumbersome and it was only finalised so far for Timisoara (data.primariatm.ro). All data stewards from the local level (where appointed) are included in the stewards network that receives regular information and invitations for participation in data events.;;;;20
15;few public bodies;As stated above, for the local initiatives, there are two approaches: some chose to upload directly on the national portal and some cities prefer to develop their own portals.

17a;yes;The information can be found in the respective legislation available at: https://data.gov.ro/pages/resources;;;;20
17b;yes;The teams are part of the same office (Secretariat General of the Government), working in collaboration with the Authority for the Digitalisation of Romania that transposes the EU legislation in the field. The collaboration is permanent.  the national open data team is the composed of the Secretariat General of the Government, that manages the national portal but also has broader coordination attributions and contributes to the legislative process on open data, and the Authority for the Digitalisation of Romania, that is in charge mainly with transposing EU legislation and limited open data attributions otherwise. The collaboration is constant but it is mainly on an inter-institutional level (online, offline, official and informal communication). For example, the law transposing the Directive was initiated and developed by both ADR and SGG. It also translates in partnership between the SGG and ADR in organising public meetings and debates (ex. https://data.gov.ro/blog/grup-de-lucru-date-deschise-pna-2022-2024) or in project implementation (ex. OECD Digital Government Review, including open data: https://sgg.gov.ro/1/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/PNP-003-anunt-website.pdf);;;;20
18;yes;Law 179/2022 states that each public entity should have an appointed data officer. Each ministry has an appointed data steward (permanently updated) and we are in a continuous process of extending this to all agencies from the central level. While the responsibilities of the data steward were imposed from the top, it was upon each ministry to decide on who to appoint, due to the differences in their internal procedures. The role of the data steward /dedicated department is further detailed in the implementing act of the Law 179/2022 (under consultation).;;;;20
19;yes;The national open data team maintains both direct dialogue with the open data officers or organises webinars, working groups, information sessions: https://data.gov.ro/blog;;;;20

32;Yes;(Review 1 - Answer revised) For the implementation of Law no.179/2022, we are now finalising the application norms, which focus on this respect on a  detailed reporting framework and include guidance on how institutions can assess re-use themselves. The monitoring and measurement framewrok uses recommendations from the Open Data Impact Measurement studies available on data.europa.eu.

34;yes; The methodology is developed to enable recurrent impact evaluations, offer recommendations for the public bodies on how to measure the impact of their own data. It uses several layers to assess impact, looking at the main publishers and re-user categories, but also using several data collection methods: user surveys, comparative analyses, portal usage, expert surveys and case studies.This will be complemented by the development of re-use impact indicators, that will be developed with the OECD as part of the project mentioned above.;;;;30

The data gathered for the study (pages 71,77-78, 81) has revealed that the impact and use of open data within the public administration is reduced (pages 85-88) and focuses mainly on increased transparency.
