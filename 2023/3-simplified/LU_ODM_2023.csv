o PSI: public sector institutions are invited to make their data available as much as possible, and to profit from existing open data.
o Metadata: an important factor in the open data project is the availability of complete and normalized metadata.
o Infrastructure: Central platform – decentralised data : Datasets are to be made available online by the data producers, either at their own websites or at the level of the national open data portal http://data.public.lu, where all existing data should be registered. Links and APIs are to be used to avoid double storage of data and versioning differences and to permit access to live data.

- data driven government and data-driven decision-making
- link with the national interoperability framework
- re-uses of open data to be documented on the national portal

Ensure, in the light of the Open data Act and the Freedom of Information Act, that more data is opened up by providing technical and legal assistance to data owners to publish their data. The focus will be on the following topics
file formats, standards, automation of data publication;
decision support for licensing;
data protection considerations.
Promote the publication of higher quality and easier to use Open data.
Collaborate with the Luxembourg government's interoperability programme to encourage the publication of data in standard and interoperable formats.
Collaborate with the Luxembourg government's AI4Gov programme to foster the availability of open datasets that can be used for AI.
Collaborate with the ecosystem established under the Data Governance Act (re-use of certain categories of protected data held by public sector bodies).
Organise events:
Collaborative hackathons on a given theme;
Training for public sector employees;
Awareness-raising events.
Improve the quality and currency of metadata through awareness campaigns and audit procedures. Quality metadata allows data to be found more easily by users of the Open data Portal.

Together with the open data strategy, Government has also retained a text about the open data project's governance https://data.public.lu/en/pages/governance/";;;;30
13;hybrid;In the beginning of Luxembourg's open data initiative, the first important data input came from interested organisations like Administration du cadastre et de la topographie, Centre des Technologies de l'Information CTIE, Transport Ministry, Statistics administration STATEC etc. Their strategic datasets allowed interesting re-uses which could be displayed int our re-use section to demonstrate the potential of opendata and to trigger further data opening. This bottom-up approach was completed later by strategic top-down measures like the creation of the divison open data et accès à l'information at State Ministry / SIP, the launch of the open data strategy working group, the collaboration with the Digital Luxembourg programme or the AI 4 Government project, and recently the official decision of the strategic texts (strategy  https://data.public.lu/en/pages/strategy/, roadmap https://data.public.lu/en/pages/5yearplan/ and governance https://data.public.lu/en/pages/governance/);;;;N/A
14;yes, all initiatives;"Luxembourg has a 2 level governance system - State level and municipality level. The municipalities (""communes"") are of very small size and apart from very few exceptions do not have the necessary means to undertake open data projects. This is why the governmental opendata project takes care to integrate the municipal governments in the national open data initiative. The responsible persons or teams are part of our opendata network and we are in contact to discover ""new"" data that can be opened and to help publishing / harvesting the data in the ODP. Some municipalities are also represented in the national geodata working group.

18;yes;"The governance text https://data.public.lu/en/pages/governance/ says ""In these roles, the division's staff cooperate on an ongoing basis with the geoportal service and regularly exchange information with the data managers and disclosure officers of public bodies."". Indeed the official letter of the Prime Minister to all ministries and governmental services https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/lettre-circulaire-aux-departements-ministeriels-administrations-et-services-de-letat-donnees-ouvertes/ orders all organisms to name official open data representatives in the scope of the open data legislation.

19;yes;"The above mentioned letter by the PM https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/lettre-circulaire-aux-departements-ministeriels-administrations-et-services-de-letat-donnees-ouvertes/ has only been sent quite recently, and actually (April 2023) the process of receiving the answers, with the names of the open data officers, is still ongoing. Therefore there have so far only been 1 -to-1 meetings with every organisation, to discuss the relevant topics like:
- co-existence of the legislation of access to information (disclosure of administrative documents) and the opendata legislation (re-use of documents and data)
- what data is concerned
- data inventory
- use of the data portal, metadata, tagging, contact and exchange with users
- data harvesting
- legal exceptions
These exchanges happen via Skype calls, and there is no documentation about these calls online unfortunately.";;;;20
20;yes;These exchanges happen on the one hand via the feedback mechanism of the portal (where there is a noticeable rise of the incoming messages and questions) and during events like the hackathons (example for last event https://govtechlab.public.lu/en/agenda/2022/hackathon-opendata1.html );;;;20

22a;yes;"The responsible team at SIP / division open data and access to information constantly monitors the national open data portal in terms of its contents, the announced data and documents, the metadata quality, the licences as well as  re-uses that document potential public interest in some of the data.
The roadmap document https://data.public.lu/en/pages/5yearplan/ specifies more concrete measures that allow to meet the strategic objectives. With regard to the Open data law https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2021/11/29/a836/jo  and the Freedom of Information law https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2018/09/14/a883/jo, the national open data team assists data owners to publish (more) data by providing technical and legal assistance, while focussing on data quality considerations, interoperability issues, legal constraints and licensing as well as possible automation of data publication.
In this context the open data team closely collaborates with the Luxembourg government's interoperability programme and the governmental AI4Gov programme to foster the availability of open datasets that can be used for AI. Both programmes consist of yearly call for projects at the level of government administration and services, where data and opendata should be an important aspect.
An important aspect is the consistent professional training for public sector employees, to help the be more aware of the opendata topics and become an active part in the open data ecosystem.";;;;15
22b;satisfactory;While especially the early adopters still continue to be dedicated to open up more data and documents, to automate several processes and to watch licence and metadata quality, we have been able to obtain new partners among the public sector organisations. They are working on internal data / document inventories, have designated open data contact persons and are starting to use the portal to publish data and to fulfill the requirements. ;;;;N/A
23a;yes;Manual follow-up by the national open data team at SIP to check this....No public sector organisation is known to charge for data.

c) lack of internal measures to take care of the open data topic in each organisation : data inventories, open data officers, internal re-use of open data in administrative processes etc";;;;N/A
24b;yes;"Challenge a is taken into account by a series of programs launched and financed by the luxembourgish ministry of digitalisation. For instance the ""NIF4Gov"" initiative which aims at making Government organisations more interoperable at every level (https://digital.gouvernement.lu/fr/dossiers/2019/NIF-2019.html) and where the opening up of data is one important element. In the same scope, there are workshops with government experts and the civil society (example https://digital.gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites/article/2023/15-03-hc-atelier1.html) to share knowledge,experience and ideas about these topics with the intention to improve the current situation.
In order to address the problem b, we go on with our permanent sensibilisation and education efforts. The Prime Minister's letter (https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/lettre-circulaire-aux-departements-ministeriels-administrations-et-services-de-letat-donnees-ouvertes/) has helped bringing the open data legislation and its obligations in the focus of decision makers, and it contains measures to help with the  organisational aspects mentioned in point c";;;;10
25a;yes;"The SIP team and the geoportal team regularly advise data holders on how to use the portal and it's API to publish data, how to choose a license, how to create good metadata, how to interact with users and what rules to follow to ensure a decent data set quality.
This assistance now goes far beyond the level provided in the past, as we offer hands-on help with the automatisation of the harvesting/publishing processes. One example is the series of datasets concerning the municipalities' land use plans, published by the ministry of internal affairs https://data.public.lu/fr/organizations/ministere-de-linterieur/";;;;15
25b;yes;"Generally, the SIP/open data team is ready to  help data providers,  when they need assistance with technical and organisational aspects. In the past for example we assisted the national statistics organisation STATEC with the publication of the statistic data API
https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/api-de-la-base-de-donnees-lustat/. Actually, we are preparing a project to implement a national central HVD non-INSPIRE-data platform, destined to welcome all the HVD-relevant non-geodata in a central data warehouse, from where the data will be made available via an API and via bulk download. Actually we are waiting for detailed HVD data lists by the concerned actors, and have started a technical analysis of this data to fathom what technical solution should be considered. In this project for example we are discussing in detail about the real-time meteorological data.";;;;10
25c;yes;"The first important step to trigger a strong general availability of national public sector geodata on the opendata portal, has been the decision about the workflow that has to be followed by any organisation that wants to use the geoportal infrastructure : any geodata has to be published as opendata under an open licence on the portal, before this data is retrieved from the opendata infrastructure to be inserted and processed in the geoportal backend, and made available in the map tools as well as in specialised tools. 
Secondly the geoportal team consequently maintains a geodata provider network and a corresponding technical infrastructure, which means that every geodata issue is solved professionally and in a collaborative way to make sure the geodata holders can provide their data as well as improve their own use of this data.
A third important aspect is the principle of centralisation : for all INSPIRE geodata, we have implemented a central technical backend, which comprises inve ntories, complex ETL scripts for all identified relevant data, a central database and a central API/webservice/download service/view service infrastructure. As already described before, we also plan to add a similar infrastructure for all non geodata HVD data.";;;;10

26a;yes;"At the national public sector training institute ""Institut national d'administration publique"" (INAP) there are actually several data-related courses on the regular program. Our  2 day training about ""introduction in data management"" has proved to be much more appreciated than expected, and due to its success we have been asked to offer it more often. Apart from this one, INAP proposes in its catalogue an interesting series of courses related to data, data bases,  geodata, digital accessibility of documents, legal aspects etc. As the individual links for each course are not permanent, here as example the link to the catalogue, searched by the keyword ""donnée"" (data): https://fonction-publique.public.lu/fr/formation-developpement/catalogue-formations/secteur-etatique.html?q=donn%C3%A9es";;;;15

This will allow to contact the re-users and to gain more insight about the respective re-use cases, which then may also be documented in PR news on social media or in news articles. Further more, it is important to know that in many cases the theme-related community is  often the most eager to provide re-uses of data from their  field - we keep a close eye on the respective communities to avoid missing interesting cases.";;;;15

We keep an eye on the exchanges between data users and providers in the corresponding portal sections, to deduce possibly interesting re-use cases, and - as far as possible with the available means - we try to know more in order  to properly document the re-use to evaluate it's impact as well as to use it as an example to trigger further visibility for open data.
A particular case are API's where it is possible to require the use of a personal key, which obliges re-users to  be identified and the data providers to get detailed information about the uses. This is also the case of the geoportal API, which is used a lot at the national level, or the  public transport API for example.

46;yes;"One topic with concretely measurable impact is the digital accessibility theme : Government's Information and Press service (Service information et presse SIP) publishes all documents and reports related to the yearly accessibility audits of public sector apps and web sites (https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/?q=accessibilit%C3%A9). The public availability of this data/documents generates a huge resonance in the public sector followed by concrete measures, that aim at improving the situation (and the scores in the audits):
- the number of accessibility declaration is rising (https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/declarations-daccessibilite/)
- the concerned community is participating actively at the selection of the web sites and apps chosen to be audited
- there are more and more officially filed complaints about accessibility issues, from stakeholders (https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/historique-des-reclamations-relatives-a-laccessibilite-numerique/)
- there is a rising interest in professional education offer about all topics related to accessibility issues
- there is a rising awareness of the problems of inaccessible documents, above all PDF documents (see f.e. this analysis https://accessibilite.public.lu/fr/news/2023-04-28-des-pdf-majoritairement-inaccessibles.html) and already a visible improvement of the situation (see image 2 in the article f.e.)
Another topic is the employment / unemployment topic : although at the current state it is hard to say whether the measures already have a positive impact, there is no doubt that the availability of statistical data (f.e. https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/chiffres-cles-de-ladem/ or https://data.public.lu/fr/organizations/institut-national-de-la-statistique-et-des-etudes-economiques-du-grand-duche-de-luxembourg/) as well as detailed analysis like in the above mentioned report (https://statistiques.public.lu/fr/publications/series/analyses/2021/analyses-05-21.html) is leading to  more precise concepts and strategies designed to improve the situation for the endangered minorities. This means on the one hand, that there is more willingness to provide high quality actual digital data, and on the other hand increasing interest in digital processes designed to use this data to improve the processes. Here for example in the work program of the national employment agency ADEM, one can find a strategic goal to digitize their processes (objective 8 p 22 https://adem.public.lu/dam-assets/fr/publications/adem/strategie-adem-2025.pdf), to better take into account the information available about the clients who are looking for a job.";;;;15

Another example is the impact created by our (quite recent) endeavor to publish without exception every document and data in regard to the digital accessibility of public sector websites and apps. This triggers on the one hand a noticeable effort on the decision makers' side to improve the situation, hoping to achieve better results the next time an audit happes, and on the other hand it leads to concrete complaints  from concerned users to have specific malfunctions corrected. Here the data about the complaints https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/historique-des-reclamations-relatives-a-laccessibilite-numerique/, and here the link to the data sets https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/?q=accessibilit%C3%A9%20service%20information";;;;15

A key objective of this strategy is to publish inventories of existing data from public sector institutions, including lists of datasets considered to be of high value, in accordance with the legislation.

High value data sets
The following themes are considered priorities
geospatial data;
Earth observation and environmental data;
meteorological data;
statistical data;
mobility data;
business and business ownership data.
In practice, we are currently (May 2023) working on 2 major projects related to HVD on the portal:
1) we have started testing the technical, financial and practical feasability of a central HVD data warehouse, designed to hold all the non-INSPIRE high value datasets, and from where the legally required bulk download and API features can be offered for all data.
2) we are currently working on an initiative to tag the already existing open data on the portal as HVD, as well as with a tag for the HVD category. First results of this action should be visible when using the search function, in Autumn 2023 : https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/?tag=high-value-dataset";;;;20

Discovery that the mere number of datasets is not necessarily correlated to the success, which several organisms seem to have with the users. Some globally perform way better in terms of user feedback than their size / visibility / mere dataset number  would suggest
Constatation that our idea of setting up a public organisation ranking would probably be useful to encourage actors to persevere, but the precise definition of the metrics to be used, in order to avoid bias or polarisation, is difficult to establish.";;;;10

National Data Portal: Central platform - decentralised data
As part of this strategy, datasets are to be uploaded by data producers to the national Open data portal data.public.lu, where the aggregation of all proposed data facilitates the search for relevant data. To manage the decentralisation of data, the national portal syndicates the content available on other portals (e.g. geoportal, INSPIRE portal, statistical portal, ...).
The portal allows data producers and portal operators to interact and exchange information about the data. Coordinated collaboration with other national data initiatives as well as with European and international data portals ensures that Luxembourg data are visible and usable in a wider context and can lead to added value contributions.";;;;30

In the data set sub-page, the portal also gives advice on open file types and an appropriate number of tags. But it is not possible to give an URL as this section is only available to data providers. See screenshot in annexed Word document.
With our new internal dashboard tool, we can monitor the metadata quality in greater detail at several levels, at the level of the portal, one organisation, or its datasets. The metadata quality is assessed following several axes on all datasets, based on the priorities defined in DCAT-AP and aggregated at the level of an organisation. ";;;;20
111b;yes;"It is possible to get the metadata quality metrics of any of our datasets by using our API.
The API call is described here: 
https://data.public.lu/fr/docapi/#operations-datasets-list_datasets
and the ""X-Fields"" header needs to have the following value ""data{id,title,quality},*""

At the level of the management dashboards, avaiable to all data providers in the portal, there are internal metadata quality checks that encourage data providers to improve the information they provide. The open data team at Service information et presse (SIP) also uses other dedicated tools to monitor the quality of some metadata aspects, and to take measures to improve the situation (f.e. at the level of tags or licenses). At many occasions we also interact directly with the providers and keep in touch through meetings and trainings.";;;;15
