40;No;"1) Since 2018 (constitutional amendmant), the open publishing of procurement data has significantly contributed to increasing the efficiency, accountability and transparency of the government for any new public procurement project. 
2) A recent constitutional amendment (B-VG Art. 20 Abs 5) stipulates the publication of studies, expert opinion and surveys. This already has significant effects on Open Government and the opening up of data for the public.
3) The Austrian government has also implemented the Transparency Portal (Transparenzportal) to make information about public spending easily accessible.

response to reviewers: 
While we do not yet have quantifiable data or specific studies to directly measure the impact of open data on governmental challenges, several mechanisms are in place to gauge its effectiveness:

1. Efficiency and Effectiveness: The open publishing of procurement data is designed to streamline the procurement process and eliminate redundancies. We are in the process of setting up metrics to quantify its impact on efficiency.

2. Transparency and Accountability: The Transparency Portal aims to make public spending easily accessible, thereby promoting accountability. User engagement and public feedback are collected to assess its impact on transparency.

3. Decision-making Capacity: The recent constitutional amendment to publish studies, expert opinions, and surveys aims to improve data-driven policy-making. While specific metrics are being developed, initial feedback indicates a positive impact on decision-making.

91;the majority of public sector data providers;"According to a general agreement between the federal level, the states, cities and municipalities, all public sector data provided for re-use has to be published via the national data portal data.gv.at. In general, data provision is regulated by existing access regulations (or regulations concerning fees). Austria still lacks a Freedom of Information Law stipulating general access rules. Thus, public sector bodies are not yet obliged to publish data according to existing (sectoral or state) laws. The decision on publishing data effectively relies within the competent public sector bodies. In general, data re-use is granted on a voluntary basis. 

However, current government plannings and the government programme foresee major changes concerning freedom of information. Furthermore, additional concrete improvements are envisaged through the transposition of the EU Open Data and Public Sector Information Directive 2019/1024.

The data.gv.at platform is designed as a metadata aggregation portal. The data (resources) remain with the data holders. The data.gv.at portal serves as single point of access to available data and represents the full picture of Austria with regard to available Open Government Data. However, at the moment it is not possible to ascertain or control from a central perspective whether all public sector data providers contribute data to the portal, neither whether a completeness of all datasets can be achieved. Obviously there is still major potential for improvements, in particular with regard to data being provided by the states, cities and municipalities.

The data.gv.at portal offers a data storage and distribution functionality, above all for small data providers, which allows for an upload of data by the data holders themselves. The contractual basis for the usage of this functionality depends on a number of parameters (eg. file size). The feature is free of charge for smaller file uploads.";;;;12

response to reviewers:
Our monitoring system offers detailed analytics and usage statistics, which allow both the portal team and data providers to gauge the performance and reach of the datasets. The ""Information concerning Data Publishers"" page provides insights into the quality and volume of published datasets, including compliance with DCAT-AP and licensing information. The ""Web Usage Statistics"" section provides real-time metrics on dataset downloads, visits, and interaction, enabling us to identify trends, user needs, and areas for improvement.

These metrics serve as key performance indicators and guide us in making data-driven decisions to enhance the portal's performance, improve dataset quality, and prioritize the publication of high-value datasets. They also enable data providers to fine-tune their data publication strategy in response to user interaction and feedback.";Please explain how the monitoring enables you to take action to improve the portal performance;;;15

106;yes;"General Information about best practices is provided on data.gv.at. The Cooperation OGD Austria serves as a forum for continuous exchange and dialogue.

Response to reviewers:
We have a structured approach to ensure that metadata is kept up-to-date, consistent with the characteristics and requirements of individual datasets. The approach involves several components:

1. Data Stewardship: Each dataset is assigned to a data steward responsible for its upkeep.
2. Time-Triggered Updates: Some datasets have predefined schedules for updates, which are built into our system to automatically prompt the responsible data steward.
3.  Event-Triggered Updates: Other datasets are updated when specific events occur (e.g., legislative changes, significant weather events).
4.  User Feedback Mechanism: Users can report issues with the metadata, which are then reviewed and acted upon.
5. Cooperation OGD Austria Forum: This serves as a platform for data providers and stakeholders to discuss best practices, challenges, and methods for keeping data and metadata up-to-date.
6.  Quality Checks: Automated and manual quality checks are performed to ensure metadata accuracy.
7. Documentation: Best practices and guidelines for metadata updating are documented and provided to all data stewards and contributors.

By combining these methods, we ensure that our metadata is accurate, reliable, and up-to-date, meeting the varying requirements of different types of data.";;Please describe the approach (and/or link to the specific documentation);;20

110;yes;"In conformity with implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138 high value datasets have to be provided in a standardized and interoperable form as default. We will continuosly monitor user feedback and feedback by other Member States or the Commission with regard to providing an adequate level of quality. 

response to reviewers:
To ensure the interoperability of high-value datasets, especially alongside the datasets of other countries, we have developed a multi-pronged strategy:

1.Standardization: Following the EU guidelines and the implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138, we are standardizing the data structures, formats, and metadata for high-value datasets to ensure cross-border compatibility.
2. API Development: We are working on the development and deployment of APIs that conform to international standards, allowing for easier data exchange and integration between different countries.
3. Cross-Border Collaboration: Initiatives are being undertaken to collaborate with neighboring countries and EU member states to create seamless data exchange platforms, particularly for datasets that have cross-border implications.
4. Quality Assurance: Automated and manual checks are being implemented to ensure that the interoperable datasets maintain a high level of quality and reliability.
5. User & Stakeholder Feedback: An open channel for user and stakeholder feedback is being maintained to identify issues and make the necessary adjustments.
6. Legal & Ethical Compliance: Ensuring that cross-border data sharing complies with legal and ethical standards is a priority. Therefore, legal teams are involved to ensure that the data sharing is in line with GDPR and other regulations.

Challenges:
1. Data Harmonization: One of the challenges is the harmonization of data collected through different methods and standards across countries.
2. Technical Hurdles: Ensuring that different data platforms can communicate effectively with each other presents technical challenges.
3. Data Governance: Ensuring that all data providers adhere to the agreed-upon standards and governance models can be difficult.
4. Resource Constraints: Implementing interoperability solutions requires significant resources, both in terms of manpower and financial investment.";;Please describe how you plan to do this;;20

111a;yes;"Data quality checks are possible via platform tools such as bulk exports. An updated ADEQUATE data quality checking instrument for metadata is envisaged (ADEQUATe - Analytics & Data Enrichment to improve the QUAliTy of Open Data).

Response to reviewers:
We employ a multi-tiered approach to monitor the quality of metadata on our portal:

1. Automated Scans: Our platform conducts automated scans at regular intervalls to assess the quality of metadata. 
2. ADEQUATe Tool: We are planning to employ the ADEQUATe data quality checking instrument for metadata, which will enable us to perform analytics and data enrichment to improve metadata quality.
3. User Feedback: We have a feedback mechanism that allows users to report issues with metadata, which are then reviewed and corrected if needed.
4. Audit and Review: We also perform a manual audit of metadata, especially for high-value datasets, to ensure that they meet quality standards.

By employing these strategies, we aim to maintain the highest possible metadata quality to ensure that our datasets are useful, reliable, and easy to find and use.";;Please also describe how you use these tools.
