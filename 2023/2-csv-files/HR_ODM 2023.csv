;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;195
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

In Annex I of Directive (EU) 2019/1024, the topics of high-value data sets are determined by specifying six thematic categories of data:
1. geospatial data https://www.geohrvatska.hr/  - The GeoHrvatska browser was developed by the State Geodetic Administration in cooperation with the entities of the National Infrastructure for Spatial Data (NIPP), in order to bring the spatial data of the NIPP closer to citizens. In a simple, mobile and intuitive way, GeoHrvatska allows the user to use the official spatial data of NIPP subjects, i.e. the public authorities of the Republic of Croatia, and with the help of their location, get to know and explore the space that surrounds them. The browser consolidates and visualizes spatial data of NIPP subjects, distributed in six thematic areas: Quality of the environment, Land, Nature around me, Free time, Protected areas and Pollution in the vicinity.

- Economic impact,
- Social impact,
- Political influence,
- Environmental impact.
At the same time, it is important to emphasize that the construction of the ex-post index of influence of the set of open data additionally includes a fifth category - the index of use. Usage index - which is constructed based on the download rate, referencing rate, rating of the usefulness of the data set by the user and the up-to-dateness of the data set.

1) Total impact index value of open data set (A)
2) Economic Impact Index (B)
3) Social Impact Index (C)
4) Political Influence Index (D)
5) Environmental Impact Index (E)
6) Usage Index (F) - Ex-post
Where A = B + C + D + E + F

B) The economic impact index is constructed based on scores on questions divided into three categories:
1. Macroeconomic impact,
2. Microeconomic and sectoral impact, and
3. Impact on the public sector.
C) The social impact index is constructed based on three categories:
1. housing,
2. inclusion of marginalized social groups, i
3. reduction of social inequalities.
D) The political influence index of the open data set is constructed based on the following categories:
1. transparency and responsibility,
2. effectiveness,
3. efficiency, i
4. decision making.
E) The environmental impact index is constructed based on the four selected most important environmental impact categories
1. Water and/or air quality,
2. Management/management of waste,
3. Environmentally friendly transport, and
4. Noise level
F) The usage index is used exclusively in the construction of the ex-post index of the influence of the set of open data after a minimum of one year has passed since the publication of the data set.
The usage index consists of:
1. download rates,
2. referencing rates,
3. evaluations of the usefulness of the data set by users i
4. assessments of the up-to-dateness of the data set based on the up-to-date report,

Accountability 
A recent application of the Association of Croatian Counties (regional level, includes 20 counties) called Open Budget enables visualisation of budget spending at regional level, using relevant criteria (sector, type, etc.). It ensures that budget data are available in unified manner, open format and visualised per different criteria. The application uses open data on spending at the county level, allowing for comparison, analysis and ensuring transparency and accountability:

In 2018, the Republic of Croatia adopted the Open Data Policy, a document whose purpose is to build and develop a stimulating environment for the creation of new social value by opening the public sector data. The fundamental goals of the policy are: maximum openness of public data in accordance with the highest standards, use of open data to create new social value, achieving a level of knowledge and awareness of the meaning and value of open data and the possibilities for their reuse, support for all open data providers and providing opportunities for capacity building in management and use and better connection of public bodies at the local and regional level, with an emphasis on the opening of regional and city portals of open data. A new open data policy is currently being prepared. Through Open data policy, we also tackle some strategic considerations about open data. 
The Croatian Parliament had adopted the Digital Croatia Strategy for the period  until 2032 (NN 002/2023).  The importance of open data is highlighted in the Strategy.

";Such mechanisms could refer to statistics that show publishers statistics concerning their data: the volume of published datasets/metadata records, information on quality of publication (formats, DCAT-AP compliance, licensing information), usage statistics such as downloads, visits, or use cases uploaded to the national portal referencing their data.;;;;15

In section 4.3 `DCAT-AP Compliance`, the focus is on DCAT-AP exclusively. We are aware that many of the respondents may be compliant with other EU standards, such as INSPIRE. For the purpose of this assessment, only DCAT-AP and its country-specific profiles are relevant.

For each catalog, all data sets and their corresponding distributions are checked.;Please note that a regular updating of metadata refers here to an updating that is in line with the characteristics of the dataset in question.
