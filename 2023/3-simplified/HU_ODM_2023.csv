The White Paper on National Data-policy was published in 2016. The policy’s main focus is on the PSI re-use. In addition, the Government Decision 1573/2020 (IX. 9.) on Hungary's Artificial Intelligence Strategy (hereinafter: AI Strategy) and certain measures necessary for its implementation have a dedicated open data leg - since the availability of open data (and PSI) is a key factor in the success of any AI initiative. Within the framework of the AI Strategy, the National Data Asset Management Agency has been established. The National Data Asset Management Agency is responsible for establishing the legal framework for open data policy in Hungary.

Translated definition of open data reuse: 
8. reuse: the use of public data or public cultural data for a commercial or non-commercial purpose that is outside the original goal for which the data were produced, as defined by the law imposing the performance of the public task within the framework of the performance of the public task;
9. making available for reuse purposes: providing access to the requester for public data or cultural public data that allows the requested data to be reused by the requester, including, in particular, the one-time or periodic transfer of data on data carriers or electronically, providing direct access to the database containing the data, and any other access method that does not conflict with any other legislation, as agreed upon by the public sector body and the requester in the reuse agreement;";;For completeness, please also write the (translated) defintiion here.;;10

The adopted Hungarian AI Strategy has a dedicated pillar and dedicated actions on data economy and data re-use. Within the framework of the AI Strategy, the National Data Asset Management Agency has been estabished as the governmental engine of the re-use of open data in Hungary.
The following acts support our observation: 
At national level there are several public bodies involved in monitoring the re-use of public data, including the National Data Asset Management Agency, the National Data Asset Council. The National Open Data Portal, which is operated by the National Data Asset Management Agency, provides a platform for data re-use nationwide. This is mandated by Act No. XCI. of 2021 on the National Data Asset  and it's implementing regulation, and the Act No. LXIII. of 2012 on the re-use of public data.
The Chapter 4.4 of the White Paper On National Data Policy contains indicators and direct acts related to the observation of the level of the re-use of open data.

In doing so, the Agency leads the development of Hungary's National Open Data Portal, where the number of views and downloads on the portal and analytics data shows the level of re-use of the country's open data.
The XCI Act of 2021 on National Data Asset (National Data Asset Act) and its implementing decree, the Government Decree 607/2021 (XI. 5.) on certain detailed rules related to the use of national data assets define the data analysis, data provision and information service tasks of the National Data Asset Management Agency. To perform these tasks, the National Data Asset Management Agency Limited Liability Company was established, which is responsible for the development and implementation of the general principles of national data asset management, the operation of the National Public Data Portal, the creation and maintenance of the public data register and the inventory of national data asset, while contributing to the fulfilment of the requirements under Act LXII of 2012 on the re-use of public data (Public Data Act).

Certain open datasets are continuously utilized by government employees, clearly making their work more efficient and effective. These include:
The authentic collection of currently effective legal regulations in electronic form in Hungary, the National Legal Database which assists in everyday legal application. It can be used free of charge. Access to the more detailed database requires registration, but it is also free and available to anyone (https://njt.hu/).

Response to Reviewer 2:

The National Data Asset Management Agency also receives inquiries from organizations seeking assistance in utilizing and recycling open data for the development of research topics or decision-making processes. Based on open data, the National Data Asset Management Agency conducts analyses for both market players and government entities, contributing to resource allocation or investment decisions. A concrete example is the preparation of higher education data analysis, which serves as a basis for government planning regarding higher education financing. Another example is a university collaboration, where the National Data Asset Management Agency assisted in supporting research related to diseases.";Are there any official posts/press releases/news pieces that mention the content of your answer? If some URLs are available, please include them.;The DESI and ODM are systematic studies, however, they apply to all EU countries. For this question, we are interested in information that describes the impact of open data in your country, such as the results of research, impact assessments, etc. Specific examples of reuse are suitable for the questions below.;;20
41;yes;"In Hungary, a number of open data solutions aim to increase the efficiency of government operations and improve the quality of services. In particular, the examples listed above have had an impact on administrative consultations and on reducing procedural time and costs, but many more examples can be given. They include:  

1. MEPÁR: https://mepar.mvh.allamkincstar.gov.hu/#/ - efficient allocation of EU agriculture funds 
2. Land Monitoring Information System: https://fir.gov.hu/ - public access to land monitoring data 
3. Road Information: https://www.utinform.hu/hu/map?n=1&l=abc&v=19.50330,47.16250,7 - use of real-time traffic data";;;;15
42;yes;"As we mentioned last year, there is a slight difference in approaches here. In Hungarian law open data means the “classic” transparency regime where the operation of the public bodies must be transparent, and all data related to this must be freely accessible. Hungary made large efforts in this field. We have one of the strongest Freedom of Information Act in the EU. The law obliges public bodies to publish certain information on themselves on their websites in a certain structure. In this regard, yes, open data made a huge impact on transparency, since a lot of information is available freely on internet on the operation of the public sector. PSI re-use, however, is a different topic, also different in legal terms. Freedom of information does not cover accessibility of public databases or datasets. A different law, a different regime is applied for PSI re-use. When we are speaking about data policy, this focuses mainly and almost exclusively for re-use related questions and has no direct effect of “classic” transparency or FOI issues. Therefore while there can be an indirect link between FOI and re-use, FOI has a constitutional, re-use has a socio-economical nature meaning that one can not direct affect the other.  

The following exemples promote the transparency and accountability of public administration: 

1. https://kormany.hu/  - FOI public data at central public administraion level published, like asset declarations or details of contracts 
2. Electronic Procurement System:  https://ekr.gov.hu/portal/kezdolap - public procurment data available  
3. Central Information Public Data Register gives information on the transparent use of public funds. https://kif.gov.hu/";;Indeed, open data in itself is a way to be transparent. However, this question is interested in examples of re-users taking the open data and creating services/ applications/ solutions/ research/ etc that have an impact on the transparency of public administrations.

An example regarding the impact created by open data in the Hungarian education system is the MTA SZTAKI KOPI Plagiarism Search Portal, which has been used free of charge by Hungarian higher education institutions for more than a decade to check the authenticity of papers and theses written by students. The essence of KOPI is that teachers can easily compare the written works of students with the text of assignments uploaded into the system, as well as with the content of other open databases and internet publications. At some universities, the results of KOPI plagiarism screening must be attached to the thesis. In case the measure of textual similarity with another piece of writing is over 10% the thesis will be rejected. (https://kopi.sztaki.hu/)
