;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;460
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

126;"Do you use a model (such as the 5-Star Open Data or FAIR) to assess the quality of deployment of data in your country?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe.";no ;;For more information, please visit: http://5stardata.info/en/ or https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/W3C04.pdf.;;;;0
127;"Do you conduct activities to promote and familiarise data providers with ways to ensure higher quality data (such as promoting the model referenced in the previous question)?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe.";yes;We get in contact with the data providers also on user days, and we promote the DCAT AP standard and ask them to join in the development of the  DCAT AP NL.;;;;;30

128b;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128a), what percentage of datasets is made available under a standard open licence or an explicit custom open licence, in a structured data format?;>90%;N/A;"Refers to open data that is available on the web under an open licence, in a structured format (=machine-readable format that is proprietary, such as .xls; .xlsx). Please note that formats such as .pdf; .jpeg; .png, .doc(x) are not considered machine-readable formats and should hence not be counted towards this answer.";;;;25
128c;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128b), which part is also in an open and machine-readable format?;>90%;N/A;Refers to open data that is published in an open (=non-proprietary) machine-readable format. A non-proprietary format is a format for which a user does not require a proprietary software package (such as Microsoft Office Excel) to explore. An example of an open format is the comma-separated values (CSV) format for tabular data.;;;;25
128d;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128c), what percentage of datasets also consistely use Uniform Resource Identifiers?;71-90%;N/A;"Refers to open data whose comprising objects are accompanied by unique identifiers. An identifier may be the object’s name (e.g. city name ‘Luxembourg’, or ‘10717’ -- a Berlin postcode), or a word describing the object (‘population’; ‘gender’), or another arbitrary identifier such as ‘XYZ0’, an identifier that makes sense only in the context of that dataset. Choosing identifiers based on known standards should be the common practice though, to facilitate data integration and linked data.";;;;20
