;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.
