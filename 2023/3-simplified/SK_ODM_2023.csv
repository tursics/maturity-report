The aim is to:
* incerasing the number of open datasets
* supporting use of open data
* increasing the open data quality (both in """"stars"""" convenience - 5stars.org and real data quality)
*supporting data economy
o Orientation towards better life quality services
o Orientation towards increasing competitiveness
o Bringing public administration closer to maximizing data usage
o Enable the modernization and rationalization of public administration through  ICT technologies (constantly improvement of services with the use of modern technologies) Additionally, there are other opendata policies that are complementary: 1) National strategy of informatization of the public administration 2021, update of 2016 strategy https://www.mirri.gov.sk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Narodna-koncepcia-informatizacie-verejnej-spravy-2021.pdf  2) Open Government Partnership National Action Plan of the Slovak Republic 2020-2021 https://www.opengovpartnership.org/documents/slovakia-action-plan-2019-2021/ 3) OGP National Action Plan of the Slovak Republic 2022-2024  https://www.opengovpartnership.org/documents/slovak-republic-action-plan-2022-2024/";;;;30
