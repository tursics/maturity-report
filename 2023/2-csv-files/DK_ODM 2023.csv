* If 'not applicable', please provide (1) a brief explanation to support your answer choice and provide (2) the URL and indicate the policy section which explicitly references objectives, actions/measures, delivery timelines etc.";yes;"o The national strategy for digitisation (2022-2026) is based on 9 visions for the digital development of Denmark, the 7th being ""A strong, ethical, and responsible digital foundation"", which includes improved access to data: https://fm.dk/media/25845/danmarks-digitaliseringsstrategi-sammen-om-den-digitale-udvikling_web.pdf, p. 45ff. An (unofficial) translation of the relevant passage would be: ""The Danish government aims to ensure that public data is usable and shareable across Danish society in ways that are effective, standardised, and data-ethically responsible. [...] The first step towards this goal is making it easy for users to find public data, and for them to evaluate what this data can and may be used for."" 
In line with this, one of the initiatives of the strategy is the development of a national metadata portal. (no. 44). Moreover, a number of the initiatives in the strategy will make more and better data available (see Q3). 

o In general, publication of Danish public sector data follows a ""publish with purpose"" principle (see the recitals to the Danish implementation of the Open Data Directive: https://www.folketingstidende.dk/samling/20201/lovforslag/L160/20201_L160_som_fremsat.pdf, 3.3.2. and the national audit authority (Rigsrevisionen's) report on open data in the public sector: https://rigsrevisionen.dk/Media/637684152375842683/309-21.pdf, p. 1)

o Public authorities are encouraged to publish any data that is not confidential or otherwise protected. A technical guide has been developed to support this effort: https://arkitektur.digst.dk/metoder/begrebs-og-datametoder/teknisk-vejledning-til-udstilling-af-offentlige-data/teknisk as well as a reference architecture for the disclosure of data by transmission: https://arkitektur.digst.dk/node/1097

6a;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to real-time or dynamic data?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"o The PSI law, the Danish implementation of the ODD, requires that dynamic data, when made available, is done so through API access, and if relevant, mass download: https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2021/176, kap. 4, §7, stk. 3
o Among other things, the strategy includes a national plan for mobility data (18) and a test of intelligent transport systems (40). These will increase the access to and usability of real time data about traffic. ";Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time). ;;;;15
6b;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to geo-spatial data (e.g. in relation to high-value datasets as specified in the implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138)?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"o The INSPIRE directive is a data sharing framework implemented in Danish Law.
The infrastructure of geodata includes data and services which are available to use and reuse for different sectors in the society. INSPIRE is built on the foundation that it is better and more economical to collect and maintain data together in a joint venture.

6c;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to citizen-generated data?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"o The strategy includes initiatives that make it easier for citizens to grant and withdraw consent or authorisation to the authorities to process and/or share their data (initiatives 8 and 9). One possible use case is the sharing of citizen-generated data. In addition to this, initiative 30 contains the plan to develop a strategy for the handling of ""self-reported"" data in the health sector.

A concrete example of this is the ""DataDonor"" initiative from the Region of Southern Denmark: https://syddansksundhedsinnovation.dk/projekter/datadonor-platformen";Citizen-generated data is the data that people or their organisations produce to directly monitor, demand or drive change on issues that affect them.;;;;15

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"o The strategy carries on and develops the work done in previous strategies with regard to data sharing across public authorities through the promulgation of common architectural principles and standards (initiative 49). The website for the common digital architecture (FDA) was recently overhauled with a focus on increased faciliation of the re-use of data and digital building blocks: https://arkitektur.digst.dk/
o Moreover, the national metadata portal (initaitive 44) also supports the re-use of open data by the public sector.";These measures should promote concepts such as data-driven government, policy-making and decision-making.;;;;15
8;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to support the reuse of open data by the private sector?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;o The national data portal is being built with private sector users of open data in mind. The same goes for many of, if not all the initiatives mentioned in 3). The portal was built in collaboration between Government and the Danish Business Authority and has conducted several user tests with private sector representatives. ;These measures could promote concepts such as smart cities and/or regions, but also new business development (in particular Small - and Medium-sized Enterprises), entrepreneurship etc.;;;;15

Examples include initiatives 24 and 35 that aim to publicize standardized product data to help companies assess their carbon footprint and plan their production in the most climate-friendly manner. 
Moreover, initiatives 58 through 61 invest in the use of digital technologies and digital skills in public education. ";Example 1: The strategy explores how open data can be used to foster the digitalisation of public services.

For justification:
*  If yes, please briefly explain how this participation is ensured. 
* If you have a different way of ensuring the participation and/or inclusion of different stakeholders in your country, please select 'not applicable' and explain.";yes;"o 1. Basic Data is governed by the Steering Group for Basic Data and a number of sub-groups/forums: https://datafordeler.dk/vejledning/grunddata/  
2. Wrt. geographic data/INSPIRE-data, The Agency for Data Supply and Infrastructure runs The Coordination Committee (""Samordningsudvalget""): https://inspire-danmark.dk/english/inspire-denmark/the-coordination-committee-for-infrastructure-for-digital-spatial-information
The committee acts as a channel for discussing political and strategic aspects of the spatial information infrastructure and government policies and management areas with geodata angles. In recent years, the Committee has, among other things, dealt with data quality in geo-referenced legislation, the interaction between new technologies and the geographical infrastructure, the quality of metadata, and the use of geodata for differentiated and automated regulation.
3. The Agency for Digital Government is responsible for two cross-government forums that deal with (open) data issues more broadly: One with representatives from upper management, another with technical personnel. 

The first is the Steering group for digital innovation and the green transition (Styregruppen for digital innovation og grøn omstilling, DIGO): https://digst.dk/strategier/den-faellesoffentlige-digitaliseringsstrategi/organisering-af-samarbejdet-om-den-faellesoffentlige-digitaliseringsstrategi/ 
The second is the Forum for data distributors (which does not have an associated website)
User feedback from stakeholders external to the public sector is provided to these groups either directly to the participating authorities, or through the National Data Portal service organisation. ";;;;;30
13;"What is the model used for governing open data in your country? 

For justification:
*  Could you briefly describe why this model was chosen/works best for your country?";hybrid;"o According to the Danish Constitution, municipalities have a right to self-government, and the state has a right to oversee this. The Basic Data Programme is governed by all three levels of government (local, regional, and national) in cooperation.

Within national government, data governance is similarly decentralised. I.e., each agency is largely responsible for deciding which data to make available as open data (with exceptions such as HVD). When they choose to do so, however, they must live up to the provisions of the PSI law. ";;;;;N/A
14;"Does the governance structure ensure that the local and regional open data initiatives are facilitated and supported at national level?

For justification:
* If yes, please give an example of what kind of support.
* If not applicable, please explain why.";yes, all initiatives;"o Open Data DK provides its members - Danish municipalities and regions - with analyses and guidance on how to publish and work with open data: https://www.opendata.dk/vejledninger-og-analyser. 
Open Data DK receives national funding and support to plan and execute open data sprints, hackathons, and other events with local and regional authorities. 
OpenDataDK allows its members to publish data or metadata on the site; moreover, users can request data from the data owners that use the portal. 

Another example is the guidelines that were issued to municipalities to increase and ease use of basic data: https://www.kl.dk/okonomi-og-administration/digitalisering-og-teknologi/digitaliseringsstrategier/den-faelleskommunale-digitaliseringsstrategi-og-handlingsplan-2016-2020/55-kommunal-implementering-af-grunddata/

Moreover, much of the data that makes up basic data is created and maintained by municipalities, as is the case with GeoDanmark (https://www.geodanmark.dk/) basic data, which includes data on the physical environment of Denmark, such as buildings, roads, trees, and bodies of water. In addition to the mandatory basic data, GeoDanmark also provides municipalities with the option to provide data voluntarily as part of the ""GeoFA"" database (https://www.geodanmark.dk/home/vejledninger/geofa/vejledninger-til-geofa/#1664803136766-bf883a42-d11f).

25b;"Are there activities to assist real-time and/or dynamic data holders in their publication process?

For justification:
* If yes, please provide some examples of such activities.";yes;"Cf. 25a

Response: I will mention two initiatives that deal with IoT devices, as these are a major source of dynamic data.

1: A mapper/transformer component (based on Fiware middleware) is being developed to help public authorities standardise the miscellany of data they receive from their IoT devices: https://www.opendata.dk/blog/nyt-komponent-skal-standardisere-det-danske-data-oekosystem. This will of course help the munincipalities themselves, but the plan is also to allow for standardised publication of metadata about the data collected by the devices.

2: Adoption of a reference architecture for observation and measurement: https://arkitektur.digst.dk/digitaliseringsstyrelsen-inviterer-til-skriftlig-kommentering-af-referencearkitektur-observation-og. Our agency is working together with the association for municipalities and other parties on a joint public reference architecture for observation and measurement across domains - adopting a common nomenclature to describe measurements of, e.g. water level in rivers, temperature in buildings or patients' vitals.";Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time).;;Kindly add if there are any activities specifically directed at holders of real-time/dynamic data;;10

;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;545
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

For justification:
* If yes, please specify it.";yes;"As defined in the Danish Implementation of the ODD: https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2021/1764 (§3, stk. 6 ""Videreanvendelse"")

Response: On second thought, the more relevant passage is probably §7: Når dokumenter og datasamlinger stilles til rådighed for videreanvendelse, skal offentlige myndigheder og offentlige virksomheder sikre, at disse er tilgængelige i alle allerede eksisterende sprogversioner og formater, herunder i elektroniske formater. Er det muligt og hensigtsmæssigt, skal dokumenter og datasamlinger endvidere stilles til rådighed i formelle, åbne og maskinlæsbare formater sammen med dokumenters og datasamlingers metadata, medmindre det ikke kan klares ved en simpel ekspeditionssag.

An unofficial translation would be: ""When documents and data collections are made available for reuse, public authorities and public companies must ensure that these are available in all already existing language versions and formats, including in electronic formats. If possible and appropriate, the documents and data collections must, moreover, be made available in formal, open and machine readable formats accompanied by metadata related to the documts and data colletions, unless this cannot be accomplished through a simple matter of form.""

The last bit, ""en simpel ekspeditionssag"", is a bit hard to translate. The point is that authorities are legally required to provide data as openly as is readily possible. This legal requirement is accompanied by a strategic goal of raising this level of openness for valuable data through targeted investments. 

";;;For completeness, could you kindly include (and translate) the definiion here.;;10

Response: Well, the question specifically asks wheter open data ""is having an impact on the society's level of awareness"", so I find it a bit confusing that ""creating awareness"" is then not a relevant criterion in your feedback. But perhaps the entire question could be reworded as it is currently imprecise (what is ""the society""?) and also focused on a quite specific issue.

Also, cf. 55

Response: As you will know, open data re-use is notoriously difficult to track, especially when it comes to language models which are often an amalgam of a number of data sources. With that said, it is very likely that e.g. the Danish Gigaword Corpus https://sprogteknologi.dk/dataset/danish-gigaword has been used to develop language models, cf. https://aclanthology.org/2021.nodalida-main.46.pdf, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-09-22/danish-ai-trained-on-data-from-a-web-forum-about-horses?srnd=technology-vp#xj4y7vzkg, and https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/viden/teknologi/heste-nettet-kan-blive-grundlag-kunstig-intelligens-paa-dansk.

128b;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128a), what percentage of datasets is made available under a standard open licence or an explicit custom open licence, in a structured data format?;>90%;N/A;"Refers to open data that is available on the web under an open licence, in a structured format (=machine-readable format that is proprietary, such as .xls; .xlsx). Please note that formats such as .pdf; .jpeg; .png, .doc(x) are not considered machine-readable formats and should hence not be counted towards this answer.";;;;25
128c;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128b), which part is also in an open and machine-readable format?;>90%;N/A;Refers to open data that is published in an open (=non-proprietary) machine-readable format. A non-proprietary format is a format for which a user does not require a proprietary software package (such as Microsoft Office Excel) to explore. An example of an open format is the comma-separated values (CSV) format for tabular data.;;;;25
128d;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128c), what percentage of datasets also consistely use Uniform Resource Identifiers?;>90%;N/A;"Refers to open data whose comprising objects are accompanied by unique identifiers. An identifier may be the object’s name (e.g. city name ‘Luxembourg’, or ‘10717’ -- a Berlin postcode), or a word describing the object (‘population’; ‘gender’), or another arbitrary identifier such as ‘XYZ0’, an identifier that makes sense only in the context of that dataset. Choosing identifiers based on known standards should be the common practice though, to facilitate data integration and linked data.";;;;25
