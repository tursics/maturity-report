;"Please note that this section differentiates between open data policy and open data strategy. Policy here refers to all principles/initiatives set out to achieve the goals established by the Open Data Directive, including specific national legislation put in place to transpose the EU law. With strategy, on the other hand, we define a document outlining the concrete vision, mission, objectives, measures to be implemented, timeline and responsible. An open data strategy would ideally include information on the open data governance structure and operating model.

;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;320
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

Please select the answer from the drop down options in the `Answer` column.
