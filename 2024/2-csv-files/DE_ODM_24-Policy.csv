P1;"Is there a national open data policy in your country and, if your country is an EU Member State, does this include a national legislation for the transposition of the Open Data Directive?

For Explanation:
* If yes, please provide (1) the URL and (2) title of the policy document and (3) briefly describe.
* If ‘other’, please provide (1) a brief explanation to support your answer choice and (2) provide the URL and indicate the policy section which explicitly references open data.";yes;"Yes, there is an open data law at federal level. In July 2017, Section 12a of the E-Government Act (EGovG) entered into force (First Open Data Act), which for the first time created a legal basis for the mandatory provision of open administrative data by federal authorities. The Second Open Data Act, which entered into force in July 2021, further adapted the content of the existing obligations under Section 12a of the EGovG and extended them to the entire federal administration.

The Data Use Act (DNG) which also entered into force on 23 July 2021 aims to modernise and replace the Information Re-Use Act (IWG). In order to improve the usability of data, open data will need to be used in machine-readable formats. In addition, the DNG stimulates open data initiatives beyond the boundaries of the federal administration and establishes the principle of ‘open by default’ also for the use of data by the Länder, municipalities and public undertakings in the areas of water, transport and energy supply. The DNG also transposes EU Directive 2019/1024 (Open Data and Public Sector Information-Directive), which was recast in 2019.

The Federal Government’s Open Data Strategy, adopted on 6 July 2021, provides a framework for action to improve the Federal Open Data Ecosystem. The Federal Government’s data strategy forms the overarching data policy framework for the Open Data Strategy. Over a period of five years, the Open Data Strategy covers three areas of action, with a total of 68 implementation measures taken by different federal ministries and authorities. The three strands of action include improving the provision of data and developing data infrastructures, increasing innovative, public-interest and responsible use of data, and promoting data literacy and a data culture to increase the quality and usability of data provided. The implementation of the Open Data Strategy is accompanied by continuous monitoring.";Confirm;;;;;;;;

For an example of an open data policy see: https://www.landesrecht.rlp.de/bsrp/document/jlr-TranspGRPrahmen 
The Rhineland-Palatinate State Transparency Act (LTranspG) came into force on January 1, 2016. It regulates access to “information”, this means official information and environmental information. The law provides for an application procedure according to which anyone can request access to information present from any so-called transparency-obligated body (this includes all Rhineland-Palatinate authorities, insofar as they carry out administrative activities). Furthermore, the law regulates that the information defined in a definite list in § 7 para. 1 and 2 LTranspG must be published proactively (officially, without having to submit an application) by the bodies subject to transparency obligations. The place of publication is an electronic platform, the so-called transparency platform, provided by the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate. In addition to the Transparency Act the government of Rhineland-Palatinate is planning on initiating an open data policy similar to the one at federal level  in order to ensure that even more government data is available to the public free of charge and in a standardized, machine-readable form. In this context, the adoption of an open data strategy is also envisaged.

Furthermore, the Federal German government funds the re-use of Open Data by the C opernicus Project amount of total funding to be handed in in later progress.

The data strategy and also the open data strategy of the government outline that the state should become the frontrunner / leader in the field of data usage and provision. This includes increasing the provision of open data; data literacy and using the data for policy making (data driven government). The potential of data is increasingly being used for more efficient and citizen-friendly service. On top the implementation and evaluation of political measures through the use of open data will be 
improved. See the statements of the government in the data strategy here: https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/975226/1693626/60b196d5861f71cdefb9e254f5382a62/2019-11-18-pdf-datenstrategie-data.pdf?download=1";Confirm;;;;;;;;

";;;;;;
P10-a;"Does the national strategy/policy mandate carrying out and maintaining a data inventory by public bodies, whether at national or local level?

For Explanation:
* If yes, please briefly specify.";yes;"Regarding the national level:
The data strategy contains several measures specifing a data inventory, e.g.:
- Verwaltungsdateninformationsplattform (VIP); published by the Federal statistical office: https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Staat/Buerokratiekosten/VIP/vip.html
- Datenatlas (this includes an inventory analysis of all the administration’s data), see:
https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1845634/0bab2b7d06c82f45361620f0c22891a2/datenstrategie-der-bundesregierung-download-bpa-data.pdf?download=1 (page 50 and 88)

- A measure of the Open Data Strategy: the Competence Center Open Data (CCOD) at the Federal Office of Administration has developed a prototype of a ""theme catalogue"" of open data. (https://opendatabund.github.io/themenkataloge/)

Regarding the regional / communal level:
Due to consitutional restrictions in Germany owing to Germany's Federal structure (Bund on the national level and the 16 Länder), the national government cannot directly mandate the federal states (Länder) or communes/cities and their respective public bodies to maintain a data inventory. However, within the limits of the German constitution, the national government has issued a law that specifies which data that must be published as open data (§12a). 
This is due to constitutional restraints (verfassungsrechtliche Hürden) but incentives were used e.g. in programmes to support local and regional initiatives (Modellkommunen/ Model Municipalities BMI) as well as dialogue formats with all regions and local authorities. Link: https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/themen/moderne-verwaltung/open-government/modellkommune/modellkommune-node.html
Based on the results of the project ""Modellkommune"", see also the current initiative of the regional open government laboratories:
https://open-government-kommunen.de/

Response to r1: The overarching Topic Page (main page) is better suited here. This page summarises all the main findings of the regional open government laboratory initiative, to which we refer in our reply.";Complement;Yes;"There is currently no obligation on federal level to create a data catalogue on a legal basis or on the basis of the various strategies in the field of data/open data.

In fact, such an obligation is currently being considered for a planned transparency law (on federal level). However, the discussion process itself has not yet started and therefore no decisions have been made yet.

In addition, there are datasets that require at least certain requirements (examples at federal level):
- Verwaltungsdateninformationsplattform (VIP); published by the Federal statistical office: https://www.verwaltungsdaten-informationsplattform.de/DE/Home/home_node.html
- Datenatlas (this includes an inventory analysis of all the administration’s data), see:
https://www.bundesregierung.de/resource/blob/992814/1845634/0bab2b7d06c82f45361620f0c22891a2/datenstrategie-der-bundesregierung-download-bpa-data.pdf?download=1 (page 50 and 88)

Due to consitutional restrictions in Germany owing to Germany's Federal structure (Bund on the national level and the 16 states/Länder), the national government CANNOT directly mandate the federal states (Länder) or communes/cities and their respective public bodies to maintain a data inventory. ";;;;;;
P10-b;"Do these data inventories include the data collected by public bodies that cannot be published as open data (e.g. in relation to the EU Data Governance Act (EU) 2022/868)? 

For Explanation:
* If yes, please briefly specify.";yes;"Yes, the Verwaltungsdateninformationsplattform (VIP, see above) specifies identifying (but not publishing) all metadata from registers, which by their nature as personal data do not entail any open data.
The German Open Data Law (§12a EGovG) currently specifies, which data cannot be published as open data. This data for instance includes individual-level personal data, research data, as well as data thay may put Germany's national security at risk. 

Furthermore the second Open Data Act (in force since 07/2021) includes a specific regime for research data requiring publication in certain cases";Complement;Yes;"As noted above, there is no legal obligation to create data catalogues. Nevertheless, for example, the Administrative Data Information Platform (VIP, see above) specifies the identification (but not the publication) of all metadata from registers which, by their nature, do not contain open data as personal data.
The German Open Data Act (§12a EGovG) currently determines which data may not be published as Open Data. These data include, for example, personal data at an individual level, research data and data that may jeopardise the national security of Germany.

In addition, the second Open Data Act (in force since 07/2021) contains a specific regulation for research data that must be published in certain cases.";;;;;;
