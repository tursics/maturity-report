1;yes;"The Ministry of Digital Affaires (MDA) (formerly the Chancellery of the Prime Minister(CPM)) pursues an open data policy in Poland based on several documents: Open Data Programme and the Open Data Act (regulations), but also Open Data Projects, Open Data Standards and the project of the National Repository of Scientific and Cultural Resources.
1. Open Data Programme: 
a. Open Data Programme 2016-2020 (pol.: Program Otwierania Danych Publicznych na lata 2016-2020)
In 2016-2020 MDA implemented first Polish open data strategy: Open Data Programme 2016-2020 (completed). The five Programme evaluation reports and one Programme finale research are published on dane.gov.pl.
b. Open Data Programme 2021-2027 (pol.: Program otwierania danych na lata 2021-2027)
The programme is a continuation of the open data strategy implemented by the MDA under the previous Open Public Data Programme 2016-2020. The new programme was adopted by a resolution of the Council of Ministers in February 2021. The Programme complements the Open Data Act and concentrates more on practical and technical mechanisms for opening data at the government level. Its main goal is among other to improve the quality and increase the amount of public data made available in an open manner. Examples of the planned activities include: increasing the amount of data resources made available by API on the dane.gov.pl portal, in particular dynamic data and high-value data and strengthening cooperation with data providers (e.g. conferences, hackathons, workshops, working meetings), increasing re-use and exchange of data, education, consolidation of Network of Open Data Officers. The Programme is addressed to the government administration but can also be implemented by other entities, e.g. public bodies at local level (cities/municipalities and regions) or private sector.

2. Regulations:
a. Act on access to public information
b. Open Data Act
In Poland constitutional right to the information is realised by Act on access to public information (Act of 6 September 2001 on access to public information). Moreover in accordance with the new Polish Open Data Act (Act of 11 August 2021 on open data and the re-use of public sector information) every person shall have the right to re-use public sector information (the right to re-use) (previously Act of 25 February 2016 on the re-use of public sector information). The Polish Open Data Act implement Directive 2019/1024 and introduces the foundations for opening and re-use data. As a general rule, all public sector content can be re-used free of charge and without any conditions (or under minimum requirements). Among the new developments, the Act emphasizes the automated and real-time provision of data via the portal and through the application programming interfaces (API), and introduces the foundations for data sharing by new entities, like public undertakings and research and scientific institutions and also data sharing by private sector on dane.gov.pl portal.

3. Open data projects: 
a.  Open data - access, standard, education 
b.  Open data plus
Open data projects support implementation of Open Data Programme 2016-2020/2021-2027. Main goal is to provide open data in manner that facilitates re-use of PSI; API development; open data portal development (dane.gov.pl); Open Data Laboratory (support data providers in the legal, technical and security areas of opening data); education; promotion open data in Poland.   
4. Project: National Repository of Science and Culture Objects (KRONIK@)
KRONIK@ (kronika.gov.pl) is a platform that collects Polish culture, science and administration heritage dispersed until recently in the digital space. It has been equipped with a multi-search engine so that it is possible to search the collected resources in both simple and advanced way, as well as on the OCR text layer. In addition, KRONIK@ provides a free repository for archiving resources and their long-term storage, securing them against removal or loss. The successive increase in the number of entities that will make their resources available on the KRONIK@ will contribute to the increase in the number of digitally available science and culture works. Currently, Kronik@ collects more than 16 million objects grouped within 70 searchable categories. In addition, Kronik@ provides anyone interested with access to the digital resources provided, as well as the opportunity to re-use these resources in their work, projects or research. Currently, the number of resources played and downloaded by Kronik@ has exceeded 2 million.
The project also developed a metadata standard introducing uniform data management rules enabling the exchange of information and integration between digital sources.

6b;yes;"Open Data Programme 2021-2027 refers to the sharing geospatial data (see p. 23, 32-33). Also Head Office of Geodesy and Cartography (provide access to current geodetic and cartographic information and co-creating a modern spatial data infrastructure) developed several documents on geospatial data opening process.
Moreover Open Data Act covers all public sectors (only some particular public sector bodies might be excluded, e.g. schools, public galleries etc). The Act  defines the public sector information definition (any content or part thereof, regardless of the format used for recording, held by public entities - all data) (Article 2.8). In principle each public entities is obligate to share to re-use a public sector information (entities obliged) (Article 3).    Therefore Open Data Act covers also all geo-spatial data held by public entities. 
Open Data Act implement Open Data Directive therefore some regulations are related to the EU law. Open Data Act introduces special rules of data sharing high-value data (eg. sharing by APIs). Such special rules apply to high-value datasets which are in the implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138. In accordance with the Polish Open Data Act the implementing regulation (EU) 2023/138 and list of specific key datasets will be in force directly in Poland. The implementing regulation will apply from 16 months after entry into force, i.e. from 9 June 2024. Public entities in Poland (entities obliged) will be obliged to sharing to re-use specific geospatial data (see: Article 25-27 the Polish Open Data Act).

The updated handbook is intended to more help build a culture of data re-use in offices. This handbook is a response to the information and education needs of the many offices that MDA has worked with the last 5 years. This edition introduces new categories of data, the use of regulations in the development of open data policies and ready-made solutions for data sharing such as the data.gov.pl and kronika.gov.pl services. Similarily to the previous edition, the current handbook does not explicitly foresee measures, but indicates the steps necessary to build an appropriate organizational structure, responsibility for opening data in the office (company) and re-use. These steps constitute a checklist for building a culture of re-use in an office (company).
In addition Open Data Standards (in particular Legal Standard) play such role (""openness template""). Also the Open Data Programme 2021-2027 and the Legal Standard introduced the Pillars of Openness (see. p. 58-59 Open Data Programme 2021 -2027). Meeting the these guidelines on public data sharing should mean giving data the attribute of openness. The Pillars of Openness was implemented to the Open Data Act  - definition of open data and principle of openness (Article 2.11 and Article 10.1). Appendix to the Legal Standard is also Check list (data providers can check that their data is open and in line with the Pillars of Openness).

Open Data Officers monitor timely publication of public data on portal according to a defined roadmap and quality of data. Open Data Programme 2021-2027 has an action plan for its implementation and provides indicators of target measurement (See: q. 5). Moreover every year the Implementers of Open Data Programme 2021-2027 (supported by Open Data Officers) are obliged to file a report on the implementation process and realized undertakings in the area of open data. On this basis MDA (Programme Coordinator) develop annual report. Also MDA develop final report that is approved by ministerial task force and filed to the Council of Ministers. The report is open to the public. Reports and Opening up Data Schedules submitted by Implementers of Programme/Open Data Officers are recognised as monitoring mechanism. Thanks to these documents MDA may track progress of data publications and control potential delays and negligence’s. Also after two and four years after the Open Data Programme 2021-2027 was adopted and in the seventh year of the document implemented, Programme will be review and evaluation.
Now (as two years have passed since its adoption), the Programme is subject to review and evaluation.
In addition the working group of strategic directions for data management was set up as part of the Task force for the implementation of the Open Data Programme 2021-2027. One of the objectives of this group is to evaluate the Open Data Programme 2021-2027.

Data is released on line free of charge, while data on request is distributed as a principle free of charge or only direct cost  might be calculated (in Polish national law marginal cost was implemented as direct cost). The only exception is for state museums and local government museums. When making available or providing public sector information for re-use with purpose other than non-commercial research, scientific or educational purpose, these entities may charge fees higher than charges established under direct cost (Article 19 Open Data Act). Minister of Culture and National Heritage establish, by way of an ordinance, the maximum charges for re-use imposed by state museums and local government museums. 
In last year we  explained that possibility charging for data above marginal cost is limited and rarely used. Early on this year MDA developed report and large research/survey on implementation Polish Open Data Act by public sector bodies. Research covered over 2.5 thousand entities (various types: local governments, courts, central administration, central institutions etc.). Surveys were completed by over 1,300 entities.

The Open Data Programme 2021-27 includes several thematic goals that will help public sector bodies to increase the reuse and measure it more efficiently (see in particular the section on p. 65 - A system of incentives to stimulate the development of the market of digital solutions and applications and data-based services). Additional priorities of the OD Programme supporting and encouraging public institutions to increse the reuse of PSI cover i.a. better cooperation between data providers and swifter exchange of experience and good practices in this regards. Special emphasis is put on stimulating the reuse of cultural resources and scientific data. Achieving this goal is supported by opening of Kronika portal (www.kronika.gov.pl) - an open repository of cultural and scientific objects. Additionally, extensive education segment supports gaining competencies necessary to stimulate reuse and measure it. https://dane.gov.pl/pl/knowledgebase/useful-materials

We measured the parameters by means of a quantitative survey, carried out using the CATI technique (computer-assisted telephone interviews) among representatives of companies responsible for data management and/or data analysis, or with people best informed about the company's situation and the area of data use. In order to achieve the assumed research goal, a stratified-random sample selection was used, while maintaining the value of representativeness due to 4 size categories of enterprises. The sample also includes the division into provinces. Such an approach in constructing the research sample allowed us to objectify our observations by generalizing them to the entire group of entrepreneurs. Based on the above criteria, 600 interviews were conducted.
In the next steps, we intend to apply (with appropriate modifications) the above solutions to other social groups and thus test and possibly verify the indicators of the impact of open data. Therefore, we treat the survey conducted among entrepreneurs as a pilot of the process of creating a methodology for measuring the impact of open data.";;;;30

To ensure monitoring of quality of open data deployment, the portal has the functionality of automatic monitoring of the quality of data (in case of files or links). Built-in validators inform the open data team and publishers about errors in shared files; the supplier can improve the resource based on the validation report.
Another example of ensuring data quality monitoring is the functionality of conversion of shared resources into higher levels of openness when sharing files in xls, xlsx, csv formats.
In addition to automatic monitoring of data quality, the open data team contacts suppliers on an ongoing basis and clarifies discrepancies in data sharing.
All these activities contribute to increasing the amount of data at higher levels of openness.";Please briefly describe how improvements are monitored (ie what does the process include). (Also, the URL re-directs to the home page);;;15
