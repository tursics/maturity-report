* If ‘other’, please provide (1) a brief explanation to support your answer choice and (2) provide the URL and indicate the policy section which explicitly references open data.";other;"The Programme of the Prime Minister Marin's Government 2019 aligned that the Government will add depth to the management of information policy (https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/marin/government-programme/best-public administration-in-the-world). Openness of public information is the overarching principle of information policy. The Government continued resolutely the earlier efforts to open up public information resources, and it drew up a quality criteria (https://www.stat.fi/org/tiedon-laatukehikko/index_en.html) that can facilitate the use of such resources.

Finland has transposed the Directive 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information (ODD) by amending the Act on Public Administration Information Management (906/2019) and with the Openness of Government Activities Act (621/1999 with amendments, https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990621) on the basis of the principle of openness contained in it.

The Openness of Government Activities Act (621/1999 with amendments, https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990621) provides for the general right to access any official document, including electronic records, in the public domain held by public authorities and private bodies that exercise public authority. Applicants are not required to provide reasons for their request or to verify their identity unless they are requesting personal or other confidential information. Restrictions apply to non-official documents, documents relating to foreign affairs, criminal investigations, police matters, information concerning military intelligence and the armed forces, as well as confidential business activities. According to the Government Programme 2019, the need to update the Openness of Government Activities Act to extend its application to data and information more broadly will be examined. The Ministry of Justice has set up a working group for 2021-2023 for the update of the Openness of Government Activities Act (https://oikeusministerio.fi/julkisuuslain-ajantasaistaminen).

There is a wider information policy report which covers a larger scale of different information policy aspects, including public, private and 3rd sectors. The Report on Ethical Information Policy in an Age of Artificial Intelligence was published on December 2018 (https://vm.fi/en/information-policy-report). It covers open data as a part of information policy and emphasizes equal access to data, while stressing the ethical development of artificial intelligence. The policy goals are fostering the progress of entire society by advancing the creation of new skills and capabilities, encour-aging innovations and innovativeness, and by improving our national competitiveness. Open data is mentioned as one of the strengths of Finland, with wide swathes of public sector data already open, and as one of the policy goals with advance access to data, transferability and compatibility of data across the Single Digital Market. Open data is also inferred as one of the enablers for de-veloping artificial intelligence based on open information and technologies, and as one of the future development potentials, with further open data policies and as part of the future strategy development.
The Act on Public Administration Information Management (906/2019, https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2019/en20190906.pdf) aims to ensure harmonised and high-quality management of data as well as secure processing of datasets of authorities to implement the principle of openness. It aims to enable secure and efficient exploitation of the datasets of authorities so that an authority may attend to its tasks and provide its services suc-cessfully and in a qualitative manner in compliance with good governance; and to promote the interoperability of information systems and information resources.

Since 2020 several parliament parties are worked in a free-form and non-political working group with an interest to the cross-party discussion on information policy topics.

4. Enabling factors

The Open Government Strategy 2030 for Finland (https://avoinhallinto.fi/assets/files/2021/03/Open_Government_Strategy2030.pdf) creates another strategical framework for openness with its key elements of open government as reinforcing dialogue in society, promoting everyone’s right to understand and to get across; and having leadership and competence ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate. It also reminds Finland’s active role to promote open government on the international level. The strategy includes open data in its open government goal with progress measuring elements. 

The IV Finnish Open Government Action Plan 2019–2023 (https://avoinhallinto.fi/assets/files/2019/09/Avoin-hallinto_IV_toimintaohjelma_LOPULLINEN_240919.pdf, in Finnish and Swedish only) emphasises openness and inclusion in three different dimensions: openness as a shared value, a strong legal foundation to openness and the continuous development of openness. These themes encompassed the following commitments for the implementation phase: 1) lasting openness by pervading all government actions and development measures; 2) the implementation of the Open Government Strategy, 3) creation of a Transparency Register to offer citizens information on the parties that seek to influence decision making; and 4) commitment and measures on open data. The realisation of commitments are monitored and evaluated during the implementation and afterwards.

6a;"Does the national strategy/policy outline measures to incentivise the publication of and access to real-time or dynamic data?

For justification:
* If yes, please briefly describe the measures.";yes;"The nation wide ‘The Opening Up and Using Public Data’ project coordinated by the Ministry of Finance of Finland developed several measures regarding open APIs, technical and semantic interoperability, as well as data quality in order to incentivise and support the publication of and access to real-time or dynamic data. The project created the API Principles to provide common instructions and recommendations for API development by adapting the JRC API Framework into Finnish public administration (https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/api4dt/news/api-framework-implemented-finland/; http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-952-367-915-3). The Act on Information Management in Public Administration (906/2019, https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/2019/en20190906.pdf) includes sections of the disclosure of datasets via a technical interface both to the authorities and to other than authorities (Sec. 22 & 24).

The existing Information Policy sets open APIs as a goal for the public sector, because open APIs are seen as the most future-proof way and as an incentive to avoid future maintenance when distributing high-quality always up-to-date and real-time data in a systematic, machine-readable format. New business models and new combinations of skills, from different fields and branches of public and private sector, enabled by the open APIs are seen as additional incentives. Open APIs are also seen as one of the key enablers for future growth.";Dynamic data is data that changes asynchronously over time is periodically updated, as new information becomes available. Real-time data is data that changes and needs updating at very frequent intervals, in most cases several times a minute. Access to dynamic and/or real-time data is most commonly provided via application programming interfaces (APIs). Plase note that real-time data is not the same as dynamic data. Real-time data can be dynamic (e.g. a variable indicating current location) or static (e.g. a fresh log entry indicating location at a specific time). ;;;;15

RESPONSE: National strategy concerning geo-spatial data includes three programmes and nice focus-points with different measures (see examples below).

Focus-point 1.1. Carbon-neutral society
Measure: The geo-spatial data industry identifies key players in terms of the carbon neutrality goal and begins cooperation with them to map customer needs and solve customer-specific problems.
Measure: Public organisations in cooperation with companies ensure high-quality and
accessible national geo-spatial data. It supports climate work, increases
the quality of top research and promotes the use of location-based methods
to achieve carbon neutrality goals.

Focus-point 1.2. Urbanisation
Measure: Together, the construction and geo-spatial data industries create and develop a digital twin covering the entire urban environment, which serves all industries throughout the life cycle.

Focus-point 2.1. Ensuring the competence
Measure: The education administration adds the basic information about geo-spatial data to the teaching programs. Students should get a sufficient understanding of the professions and training places offered by the geo-spatial industry.
";"Geo-spatial data is data that contains information on properties that are linked to a position on earth.

Thus that, an authority may attend to its tasks and provide its services to public administration clients successfully and in a qualitative manner, in compliance with good governance.

The Ministry of Finance’s project ‘Opening Up and Using Public Data’ (2020-2022) promoted wider and more effective use of public data throughout society (https://vm.fi/en/opening-up-and-using-public-data). The project enhanced the use and share of public data in order to support the data holders and publishers. As a part of the project, the operational model for data sharing was created to make public sector data available more systematically either as open data or for wider use than at present, primarily via APIs (https://www.avoindata.fi/en/operating-model). The operating model supports data sharing by describing the stages, obligations and recommendations that public administration actors should take account when planning any data opening actions. Also the resolution of the strategic aims on using and opening up data to make the policy goals more concrete and enhance their implementation were adopted at the government session on 17 March 2022 (https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/164023/VN_2022_33.pdf).

The Information Management Model is maintained to design and implement the management of services, consideration, and datasets; to implement the rights and restrictions relating to access to information; to decrease multiple collection of information; to implement the interoperability of information systems and information pools; and to maintain information security. The Ministry of Finance of Finland maintains the Public Sector Information Management Map, which describes the data resources to utilise and the procedures for accessing data from the data resources (https://www.exploreadministration.fi/information-management-map-of-public-administration/).

The Act on the Openness of Government Activities (621/1999, https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990621) mandates the catalogues listing the data inventories to be published as open data. These catalogues give an indication on what each data or information repository holds, for example the City of Vantaa's catalogues of information systems (https://hri.fi/data/fi/dataset/vantaan-kaupungin-tietojarjestelmaluettelo). The dataset provides a list of all information systems in use at the city and information on system ownership, technical responsibility and a brief description of each information system.

The GDPR has also necessitated that all data providers review their data storages and identify personal data for the GDPR coverage, and as part of this review, build the necessary metadata to be able to properly catalogue and identify the data for each data repository.

To make the descriptive metadata of these models and lists better semantically interoperable, data holders and model maintainers, from both public and private sector, can utilise the Interoperability Platform (https://dvv.fi/en/interoperability-platform), a workbench and a set of tools, for defining and describing interoperable data content. The platform consists of glossaries, code sets and data models needed for data flows and in other areas of information management.

There is members from governmental organisations and agencies, municipalities as well as from academia involved to the group. So far, two webinars have been held with the group, and the next one has been scheduled for June 2023. More information about the implementation project is available https://vm.fi/hanke?tunnus=VM053:00/2020. The national open data portal, Opendata.fi, has an initial understanding of nationally prioritised high value datasets, that enable for example software developers to scale their service on a European level. The national portal has also an understanding of the high value categories and initial data sets formed with the key regional stakeholders, such as, the Helsinki Region Infoshare HRI (https://hri.fi/en_gb/) and the 6 largest cities of Finland. 

Discussion related to the high-value open data in Finland is ongoing in different formats and environments, for example in the Finnish Open Data Ecosystem Facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/102381085627). The transposition of the Open Data Directive's implementation acts will provide further guidelines. The project on Opening Up and Using Public Data has also created a model to support data prioritisation process (BRC Assessment Tool https://www.avoindata.fi/en/operating-model). At the local level, there is social media groups for local discussion, for example in the Jyväskylä region (https://www.facebook.com/groups/opendatajkl), Pori (https://www.facebook.com/groups/opendatapori), Tampere (https://www.facebook.com/groups/opendatatre) and Turku (https://www.facebook.com/groups/opendatatku).

On local level, for example the Helsinki Region Infoshare HRI carries out regular consultations with data providers. The measures are planned as a part of the annual working programme, see for example year 2022 Chapter 2.7. pages 20-24, https://www.hel.fi/static/hel2/tietokeskus/data/dokumentit/HRI_toiminta_ja_taloussuunnitelma_2022.pdf, in Finnish only. It is possible to suggest open data needs to the HRI (https://hri.fi/en_gb/new-data-request/) and ask them to open data that the development community considers valuable. The HRI also regularly asks for suggestions to open useful data in developer meetings, annual user survey and in their social media channels. All larger cities have their channels to collect suggestions about datasets to open, for example the city of Oulu: https://data.ouka.fi/fi/uusi-datatoive/ and Tampere https://data.tampere.fi/fi/uusi-datatoive/.";Stakeholders could refer to open data reusers (business, civil society) or other actors that might not be direct reusers of the data (e.g. engaged or interested citizens).;;;;10

* If you have a different way of ensuring the participation and/or inclusion of different stakeholders in your country, please select 'not applicable' and explain.";yes;"There is not a specific open data governance model available for governmental level. Nor is there any common model for participation or inclusiveness for or of open data holders and distributers. Instead, there is several models and processes available for public sector bodies in all levels to participate stakeholders. The Act on Information Management in Public Administration (906/2019, https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/2019/en20190906.pdf) creates a common governance model and instruments to steer, encourage and support public administration's information management including open data. A specific open data governance model is not included in the act. Thus, open data is considered to be an integrated part of any organisation’s or information management entity’s work flow or data resources. Some of the solutions have been described in the operational model of data sharing https://www.avoindata.fi/en/operating-model.

As part of the continuity of the implementation of the Ministry of Finance's 'Opening up and using public data' project, Statistics Finland maintains a cooperation network related to data quality. The network brings together parties working with data quality, shares and increases competence, and develops the quality of data and its descriptions together (https://www.stat.fi/org/tiedon-laatukehikko/tiedon-laadun-yhteistyoverkosto.html). In addition, the Digital and Population Data Services Agency maintains a cooperation network related to API development. The network will meet approximately eight times in 2023 (https://www.avoindata.fi/fi/rajapintaperiaatteet/verkosto). 

The national open data portal Opendata.fi does not have a formal body of governance set up. Its governance and budgeting is arranged as a part of the Digital and Population Data Services Agency’s governance processes and budgeting. The portal team regularly consults and shares development roadmaps, synchronizes development, and agrees mutual approaches on for example harvesting, data archiving and expiration, data sets of high value, with key stakeholders like Helsinki Region Infoshare HRI.fi and the six largest cities of Finland. These quarterly talks are cooperative rather than directive in their nature. Opendata.fi and hri.fi portals also receives community feedback on portal development plans through hackathons and events.
Helsinki Region Infoshare service and Lounaistieto service organize events which gather different open data stakeholders to participate (https://hri.fi/fi/ohjeet/datan-hyodyntajalle/kehittajayhteistyo/).

13;"What is the model used for governing open data in your country? 

For justification:
*  Could you briefly describe why this model was chosen/works best for your country?";hybrid;"Open data governance in the public administration is arranged as a part of common information management governance. The Act on Information Management in Public Administration (906/2019, https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/kaannokset/2019/en20190906.pdf) creates a common governance model and instruments to steer, encourage and support public administration's information management including open data. A specific open data governance model is not included in the act. Thus, open data is considered to be an integrated part of any organisation’s or information management entity’s work flow or data resources. 

Governance of publishing data is out of the act’s scope and publishing processes are regulated, among other statutes, by the Openness of Government Activities Act (621/1999 with amendments, https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1999/en19990621). It provides for the general right to access any official document, including electronic records, in the public domain held by public authorities and private bodies that exercise public authority. Restrictions apply to non-official documents, documents relating to foreign affairs, criminal investigations, police matters, information concerning military intelligence and the armed forces, as well as confidential business activities.

The roles and tasks of self-governance takes place naturally on the various levels of public administration and public sector activities. When it comes to the municipalities, they enjoy wide autonomy secured by the law. One of the challenges of this approach is total 309 muncipalities with local governments, majority having a population of less than 20,000 inhabitants.

The national open data portal, Opendata.fi, focuses on guidance and assistance of data providers rather than trying to carry out or organise the various efforts to open data.";;;;;N/A

Situation also increases general expectations for influencing legislative drafting, especially revision of the Directive establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the EU (INSPIRE).

At the moment, there is a really active phase going on in terms of EU legislation regarding digitization and data management. The amount of regulation and its difficult interpretation may cause challenges especially for small actors and possibly also affect the willingness and resources to open data.

An employee has the right, based on a statute, to take study leave in one or more periods, full time or part time, for at most two years during a period of five years, if his or her full-time employment relationship with the same employer has lasted for at least one year in one or more periods. If the employment relationship has lasted for less than a year but at least three months, the employee is entitled to take study leave for a maximum of five days.

Several universities, open universities and colleges has included lectures and courses about open data and its applications in their curriculas to support and to create possibilities to learn and to gain information about open data (https://www.avoin.jyu.fi/opinto-opas/fi/opintojakso/itkp9102/; https://fitech.io/fi/opinnot/data-ja-vuorovaikutus/; https://research.tuni.fi/researchdata/trainings/ ; https://research.tuni.fi/datapalvelu/menneet-koulutukset-2022/; ). There is also e-learning modules with open data related content in the public administration's e-learning portal (eOppiva.fi). Part of the courses are available as science for all, open university or MOOC courses. For SME's there was the Growth from Data (Datasta kasvua) serie of webinars (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFMs9Qmp5uLJHszrDcuCAricrk0tcQ33s). A specific curricula for open data studies does not exist.

Government agencies has purchased specific open data training and courses how to prepare for and to open data assets from different companies and associations. The Statistics Finland has also provided trainings. The 'Opening Up and Using Public Sector Data' project created an user-driven action model for public administration to identify, prioritize and open up information together with stakeholders (https://www.avoindata.fi/en/operating-model). The model will be enriched with available, useful material, for example from the European Data Portal. The project also created e-learning courses on the model but also on data interoperability and data quality. These courses are freely available on the public administration e-learning portal eOppiva (https://www.eoppiva.fi/kokoelmat/dealing-with-data-more-efficient-use-of-information/). Anyone interested can launch these e-learning materials at their convenience.

The cities of Helsinki Region Area (hri.fi) arrange training events about 8-10 times a year to the public servants of the cities in the capital region. For training materials, see https://hri.fi/fi/ohjeet/datan-avaajalle/koulutusmateriaalia/.

There are also plans to begin cooperation to produce open data training materials within the Digital and Population Data Services Agency, deployed by two of its services and teams, the National Open Data Portal, opendata.fi, and the Finnish Service Catalog, (https://www.suomi.fi/services/suomi-fi-finnish-service-catalogue-digital-and-population-data-services-agency/d93be162-07a2-45f2-84b3-f794da852b58), to get further assistance on creating materials.";Ideally such trainings are organised in the frame of the professional development programmes for civil servants and address both data literacy and skills.;;;;15

;Dimension 2: Open Data Impact;;;;;;;415
;"Assessing the impact of open data is still generally considered a new field, with no consensus, for example, on the definition, or methodologies to measure impact. Nonetheless, there are several elements that are considered essential to demonstrating impact, such as monitoring and measuring the reuse of published open data. Given this, the impact dimension in this questionnaire tries to capture the extent to which countries have been making progress in monitoring the reuse of open data and based on that, in measuring the impact of open data on specific governmental, societal, environmental, and economic challenges of our time. Countries are encouraged to provide, whenever possible, examples of reuse for each impact area/topic. Yet, please note that data.europe.eu does not consider the availability of reuse examples as a direct evidence of impact.

* If yes, please specify what kind of data proves this impact and provide the URLs to this data.";Yes;"RESPONSE: Good point. In the evaluation of the state aid reform, the effects of the reform have been discussed from the point of view of transparency and utilization of information, but it is more of a qualitative assessment than a quantitative study. 

Example: ""From the point of view of citizens, the clear positive effect of the reform of state aid activities can be considered to be that increasing the openness and transparency of information about state aid promotes the realization of the openness of administration and the principle of publicity included in fundamental rights. In particular, increasing the transparency of information about state aid improves the possibilities of monitoring the use of public power and funds. Increasing transparency also improves citizens' participation rights.""

More information on the FMI website: https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data. 

An impact study focusing on data usage in 2018 and a user survey on the FMI Open Data Services was conducted in 2019 which proved the value of open data information for business, public sector, and citizens. According to the study, FMI open data has a significant impact on business. 14% of the private company respondents said that FMI open data have generated new business during last 3 years (N = 389; 14 % of 389 = 54 companies). 

User survey and impact study results

Use of open meteorological data through the FMI Open Data Services:
- Most users use interpolated timeseries
- Large datasets are disseminated via AWS and it’s important for heavy users
- Timeseries API is crucial
- Summer is the busiest time of the year (three times more data requests)
- Removing of API-key increased significantly data requests
- Guidelines and manuals were used by approx. 60% of the users
- 25% of respondents use FMI open data with other open data  
- Four top datasets cover over 3/4 of requests:
o Station specific weather observations
o Weather forecast model HIRLAM (production was terminated in late 2022)
o Lightning strikes
o Weather radar images

Users of the FMI Open Data Services:
- Over 60% of users couldn’t be recognized. However, 80% of recognized users were companies and only 6% from public sector. 
- The companies requested mostly weather forecasts and surface observations and public sector used a lot of road weather observations

FMI Open Data Services is used for example in:
- teaching students in the elementary and high school
- water supply and waste management services, especially for forecasting waste-water flow 
- displaying real-time and historical marine weather data as background information in our services for the users
- estimating solar power production

Access to FMI Open Data Services

Access to FMI open datasets through the web interfaces:
• Discovery Service (a.k.a. Catalog service) providing metadata about the available data sets and services, implemented using the OGC Catalog Service for Web (CSW),
• View Services giving a visual preview of the available data sets, implemented using OGC Web Map Service (WMS), and
• Download Services providing a continuous online access to the most up-to-date data, implemented using OGC Web Feature Service (WFS).

The National Land Survey's laser scanning project (2020-2025) produces more detailed open data for predicting and managing flood risks. The project is still in progress, but the impacts and benefits have been assessed in the Excel file (Taloudelliset hyödyt -tab, point 7) attached to the response.

RESPONSE: The impacts have been evaluated from the point of view of data utilisation. For example, regional administration authorities and municipalities can use new laser scanning data to combine flood risk data with land use data (buildings, construction plans), which in the future will increase people's safety and reduce material damage.

Additional information: We have also the CO2data.fi online service that provides objective data on the climate impact of construction products used in Finland, such as carbon footprint and handprint, material efficiency and recyclability. The data harmonises the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of buildings and facilitates the design of a low-carbon building.

Lounaistieto has succeeded in this task excellently through long-term work (https://turunkauppakamari.fi/news/lounaistieto-palkittiin-vuoden-ict-teko-tunnustuksella/).

RESPONSE: After review, our original answer is not suitable for this question. However, the utilisation of open data in the context of new innovations has increased, but this is more visible in business creation. There are more and more companies basing their business on open data, for example Vainu's (www.vainu.com) business idea is to collect open, public data and use it to form an accurate situational picture of companies.

We are in the process of finalizing our GeoDCAT-AP support, and are cooperating with select data publishers to assist them in ensuring that
the harvested metadata provides at least the mandatory and recommended metadata for GeoDCAT-AP compliance.
4 = A large number of data sets (esp. maps and other geospatial data) on the Finnish portal carry additional metadata that is not explicitly identified in the DCAT-AP specification.

Please note that formats such as .pdf; .jpeg; .png, .doc(x) are not considered machine-readable formats and should hence not be counted towards this answer.";;;;25
128c;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128b), which part is also in an open and machine-readable format?;71-90%;N/A;Refers to open data that is published in an open (=non-proprietary) machine-readable format. A non-proprietary format is a format for which a user does not require a proprietary software package (such as Microsoft Office Excel) to explore. An example of an open format is the comma-separated values (CSV) format for tabular data.;;;;20
128d;Of the percentage indicated in the previous question (Q128c), what percentage of datasets also consistely use Uniform Resource Identifiers?;>90%;N/A;"Refers to open data whose comprising objects are accompanied by unique identifiers. An identifier may be the object’s name (e.g. city name ‘Luxembourg’, or ‘10717’ -- a Berlin postcode), or a word describing the object (‘population’; ‘gender’), or another arbitrary identifier such as ‘XYZ0’, an identifier that makes sense only in the context of that dataset. Choosing identifiers based on known standards should be the common practice though, to facilitate data integration and linked data.";;;;25
